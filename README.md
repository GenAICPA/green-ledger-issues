# Green Ledger Issues

This repository is a collaborative space for thinking through the issues related to a public, transparent, cryptographically supported, trustworthy, and auditable information supply chain for non-financial measures, with a focus on sustainability.

## Introduction

The core of this repository is a document that lays out approximately 50 key questions to consider when designing a "Green Ledger". The goal is to engage a large community in a structured discussion to refine these questions, develop robust answers, and explore the future of sustainability accounting.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

-   `questions/`: Contains a separate Markdown file for each of the 51 questions. Each file includes the question, a short answer, and a detailed answer, and is intended to be the focus of discussion and pull requests.
-   `clusters/`: The questions are grouped into six thematic clusters. Each directory in this folder represents a cluster and contains a `README.md` that links to the relevant questions.
-   `source_documents/`: Contains the original `.docx` document that initiated this project, as well as the extracted plain text version used for parsing.
-   `scripts/`: Contains the Python scripts used to parse the source document and populate the question files.
-   `.github/`: Contains templates for issues and pull requests to guide the contribution process.

## How to Contribute
