## Short Answer

Minimise data, pseudonymise IDs, encrypt at rest, log access.

## Detailed Answer

Not yet in a comprehensive way, as far as widely adopted standards go – there isn’t a single global “Standard Audit File for Sustainability” that parallels SAF-T for tax. However, there are some initiatives and pieces that hint at movement in this direction:
The OECD’s SAF-T is specific to tax, and ISO 21378:2019 provides common definitions for accounting audit data. For ESG, we haven’t seen OECD propose a similar SAF for environmental or social data. That said, the OECD has guidelines like the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, but those are principles, not data file formats.
ISO does have relevant standards, but they are mostly management system standards or performance standards, not data interchange formats. For example:
ISO 14064 (GHG quantification and reporting) standardizes how to measure and report GHG emissions for verification, but it doesn’t specify a data file format. It’s more about methodology.
ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System) and ISO 45001 (Occupational H&S management) include requirements to keep records and report certain things, but again not a unified data structure to export for audit.
The question references ISO 207 — likely meaning ISO/TC 207 which is the technical committee for environmental management standards (which created ISO 14000 series). To date, ISO/TC 207 hasn’t published a SAF-T-like standard specifically for environmental data extraction. ISO 21378 (developed under ISO TC 295 for digital audit data) is about financial data.
There is an ISO project: ISO 14097 on climate-related financial disclosures (forthcoming) but that’s guidance on assessing investments, not a data format.
GRI and other frameworks: They provide standards for what to report (GRI Standards) but not a specific machine-readable file format akin to SAF-T. However, GRI has endorsed XBRL usage for its standards in the past – there was a GRI Taxonomy developed to allow XBRL filings of GRI data. It was not widely enforced but some regulators (e.g., South Africa’s regulator experimented with requiring XBRL for integrated reports). This is a pseudo analog: XBRL is to ESG what SAF-T is to tax, in the sense of enabling data exchange. Now, with CSRD, the ESRS XBRL taxonomy effectively becomes a standardized data format for audited ESG data in the EU. If that is considered a de-facto standard, one could say “Yes, it’s being developed (by EFRAG/ESMA) in the form of the ESRS digital taxonomy”.
UN/OECD efforts: The question mentions OECD, maybe thinking of something like OECD’s work on SAF-T or their interest in data. The OECD has a Centre for Corporate Governance and an upcoming sustainability reporting repository (they have convened some discussions on aligning standards globally but not a file format). The IFRS Foundation’s ISSB might be the closet analogous body to develop something global, but they are focusing on standards content, leaving format to jurisdictional implementation (like digital taxonomy by regulators).
Engine B / Open Audit File: There are initiatives by accounting firms to ease data sharing for audits (Engine B in the UK tries to standardize how client data is collected for audit and analysis, somewhat like an open SAF-T including broader data). Engine B initially focused on financial, but its concepts could extend to ESG data. The mention of “Engine B” in Q49 suggests recognition of these attempts. If audit firms see ESG assurance growing, they might push something similar to gather ESG data consistently from clients.
The EU’s efforts: The EU is kind of at the forefront by mandating digital tagging of ESG reports. Also, there’s mention of something like an “audit data standard for ESG” possibly under discussion in some forums like IAASB or others, but not concrete. The IAASB is focusing on assurance standards (ISSA 5000), not the data format.
Partnerships for data interoperability: PACT (WBCSD’s Partnership for Carbon Transparency) aims to allow different carbon footprint tools to interoperate. While not an official standard like SAF-T, it is essentially developing a common specification (the Carbon Data Interoperability standard) for product-level emissions data exchange across platforms. That’s a narrower scope (Scope 3 product emissions), but notable.
SAF-T parallel in certain countries: Some countries might develop their own audit file for sustainability in the future, especially for carbon. For example, if a carbon tax expands, tax authorities might want companies to submit a data file of emissions sources (like SAF-CO2). But no known broad one yet.
So, the direct answer: No formal comprehensive audit data standard for ESG has been finalized by bodies like OECD or ISO at this time. However:
Europe’s CSRD with digital taxonomy is arguably a move in that direction (covering many metrics).
There's clear recognition of the need (the question itself indicates interest).
We see partial elements: ISO standards give definitions (like ISO 14064 for carbon calculation – akin to content of an audit file but not the format), and XBRL taxonomies (GRI, ESRS) give format for disclosure.
It might be fair to say the field is still emerging. We can cite that ISO has identified robust ESG data as a challenge, and the IAASB acknowledges the need for standardized data for assurance.
In conclusion, no widely adopted SAF-T-like standard specifically for ESG yet, but one can point to ESRS XBRL taxonomy as a major step, and the need is recognized by standard setters (who might look to integrate ESG into digital reporting frameworks soon). Until then, companies rely on frameworks and evolving taxonomies to structure ESG data, and assurance professionals adapt existing audit data approaches to ESG context on a case-by-case basis.
