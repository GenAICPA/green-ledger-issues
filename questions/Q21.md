## Short Answer

Sensors offer objectivity; estimates and scope inject subjectivity.

## Detailed Answer

Many ESG facts can be captured with objective methods, but their measurement often involves assumptions and context that introduce a degree of subjectivity or perspective. In other words, collecting the raw data might be straightforward, but deciding what to measure, how to measure it, and how to interpret it can be quite dependent on one’s point of view or the intended application.
Let’s break it down:
Objective Data Capture: Some things are plain data. For example, the temperature of a smokestack exhaust, the number of employee injuries, the gallons of water withdrawn – these can be measured by instruments or counted, yielding objective numbers. Modern ESG reporting encourages using actual data where possible (e.g., using smart meters to get exact energy use). Technologies like IoT and satellite imaging are improving the objectivity of environmental data (e.g., directly measuring deforestation via satellites rather than relying on self-reported estimates).
Subjectivity in Measurement: However, the moment you aggregate or contextualize those numbers, choices come in. Suppose you have objective measures of gas composition from a factory. Converting that to “CO₂ equivalent emissions” involves choosing global warming potential factors for methane, etc., which can be updated or different (e.g., 100-year vs 20-year horizon GWP – a matter of perspective on what timeframe matters). Or consider employee data: counting “employees” seems objective, but the initial example given – two people sharing one role, is that one employee or two? Different stakeholders might define it differently (some might count full-time equivalents = 1, others count heads = 2).
This shows definitions matter: what is an “employee,” what counts as a “renewable” source, what qualifies as a reportable incident? Often these are defined by standards (GRI, SASB, etc.), but companies might interpret edge cases differently. And some standards give flexibility or require judgment calls.
Point of View for Application: ESG data is used by different groups for different reasons. A regulator might be interested in absolute emissions; an investor might care about emissions intensity per product; a local community might focus on a subset of emissions that affect local air quality. The fact itself (total emissions) could be objectively captured, but each group might emphasize a different slice or metric derived from it. So the nature of the fact is objective, but the measure of the fact (how it’s reported or framed) can be driven by point of view. For example, a company might prefer to report “emissions per dollar revenue” if that flatters their performance, while an NGO might highlight total emissions or emissions per unit of output – both are valid measures, but the choice reflects perspective.
Scope and Boundaries: This is a big area where perspective rules. Under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, emissions are categorized into Scope 1, 2, 3. Scope 3 especially depends on how far you look – some may include certain categories, others not (often due to data availability, but also materiality judgments). Deciding boundaries (organizational boundary for reporting, operational boundary for processes) is partly subjective. A company could technically capture every molecule of emission in its supply chain (with enough data), but deciding whether to include the emissions from, say, customers using its product is a perspective – financial materiality vs environmental responsibility. The EU’s double materiality concept explicitly acknowledges perspective: impact materiality vs financial materiality can lead to different sets of facts being “relevant.”
Context and Interpretation: Facts rarely speak for themselves. If a factory reports 1,000 kg of NOx emissions, is that “good” or “bad”? It depends on context – the local legal limit, the size of production, etc. Stakeholders will interpret that through their lens (regulator: did it breach permit? local resident: is air quality safe? company: did we meet our target?). So while the number is objective, its significance is in the eye of the beholder. A Green Ledger should ideally provide context (e.g., benchmark data, thresholds) to aid interpretation, but still, viewpoint matters in drawing conclusions.
Future and Risk Assessments: ESG reporting often involves forward-looking info (climate scenario impacts, risk likelihoods) – these are inherently not fully objective because they are projections and depend on which scenario or model is chosen. Two analysts might have different risk assessments from the same data due to different risk appetite or scenarios considered.
In conclusion, purely objective capture is the goal for the raw data (and technology and standards are moving us closer to that – ensuring data is accurate and not manipulated). But the selection of what facts to capture and how to present them will always carry some perspective. That’s why transparency about methodologies is crucial. A Green Ledger should document how each metric was measured (e.g., emission factors used, boundary set, any exclusions) so that users with different viewpoints can adjust if needed.
We can say that ESG facts can approach objectivity under standardized methods, but since sustainability intersects with societal values and judgments (unlike counting cash, which is straightforward by comparison), what gets reported will always reflect certain priorities. For example, one company might proudly report “jobs created” (positive social impact), while others might highlight “taxes paid” as their contribution – each is a perspective on what is a valuable outcome.
Thus, a robust Green Ledger will allow multi-perspective analysis: the data should be rich enough that if one stakeholder wants to apply a different lens (say, count part-timers differently, or include a category of Scope 3 the company omitted), they can do so. In essence, objective data, subjective context – both aspects exist, and acknowledging that will make the ledger more useful and credible.
