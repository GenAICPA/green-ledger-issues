## Short Answer

Possible for physical flows; social metrics rely on reference cross-checks.

## Detailed Answer

Possibly, in specific domains – and some frameworks are attempting this – but it’s challenging to generalize. The idea of “Green balancing equations” means defining something like an environmental balance sheet or P&L where various sustainability metrics obey a conservation or balancing law (similar to how financial statements must balance). In certain cases, this is straightforward: for example, carbon accounting often treats greenhouse gas emissions and offsets in a balancing manner (tons emitted vs. tons sequestered or offset). One could imagine a basic equation like Beginning carbon credits + acquired credits – used credits = Ending carbon credits, analogous to an inventory equation, which must hold true for a company’s carbon credit account.
On a larger scale, climate scientists and global organizations do talk about a “carbon budget” – a fixed amount of CO₂ the world can emit to stay under a temperature threshold. At a planetary level, one could envision a balance sheet of the planet: total allowable emissions (as a liability or budget) matched against the assets of emissions reductions and removals. In fact, a public “climate ledger” concept is that the balance sheet of our planet must live on a public ledger, where climate assets (like credits for emission reductions) and climate liabilities (emissions) are tracked in tandem. This implies a form of balancing equation: e.g., for any scope of analysis, you could set Total Emissions – Total Reductions = Net Impact, which ideally should trend to zero for sustainability.
In practice, efforts to create ESG balance sheets and income statements are emerging. Multi-capital accounting frameworks (like the “Triple Bottom Line” or more recent methodologies) try to put environmental and social resources into an accounting structure. For instance, one approach provides an ESG balance sheet and P&L in parallel to the traditional financial statements. In a sample “ESG Balance Sheet,” you might see “Environmental Assets” (like the value of ecosystem services preserved or emission allowances held) on one side and “Environmental Liabilities” (like obligations to reduce pollution, or actual pollution outputs treated as a liability) on the other, plus an “ESG Equity/Capital” representing net sustainability value. Academic proposals even define accounts such as ESG-Asset, ESG-Liability, and ESG-Equity and apply double-entry logic to them. These attempts essentially formulate cross-period accumulators and balancing items for ESG (see Appendix for examples of such models).
That said, establishing universally accepted green equations is difficult because sustainability involves many different units and phenomena. Unlike money, which is a common unit allowing all transactions to be summed, ESG metrics range from CO₂ tons to water liters to social indices – adding those up directly doesn’t make sense. One can develop balancing equations within a particular metric (e.g., a water ledger where water withdrawn minus water returned equals net water consumption, which should match what’s accounted for across sites). But an overarching equation akin to Assets = Liabilities + Equity for “sustainability” in general is elusive. There is no single unit of “sustainability” to ensure everything balances, and subjective judgments (e.g., how do you quantify the “asset” of community goodwill?).
In summary, specific balancing frameworks can be made: for instance, carbon accounting often works like a ledger with balancing of emissions and offsets, and experimental ESG accounting models do create balance-sheet analogues. These can certainly help bring rigor (ensuring completeness within that framework). However, a full set of green accounting equations covering all ESG facets is still in early development and may never be as clean-cut as financial equations, due to the diversity and incommensurability of many sustainability factors. Nonetheless, pursuing such equations (even if separately by metric or capital) is valuable – it forces clear definitions and can expose when something hasn’t been accounted for (just as an out-of-balance financial ledger indicates missing info).
