## Short Answer

Cost, data-quality gaps, IP concerns, change fatigue are barriers.

## Detailed Answer

Preliminary work:
We have essentially been discussing a document "Fifty Questions..." as preliminary thought leadership (the scenario here). But beyond that:
Academic proposals: People like the question author (Eric Cohen) and others in XBRL community have raised the idea of integrating ESG into accounting data structures. For instance, there might be academic papers or proof-of-concepts on "ESG balance sheet" or triple-entry accounting for carbon credits. There are also initiatives like the CAP (Comprehensive Accounting in Respect of Ecology) model in France that propose modifications to accounting for sustainability.
Corporate experiments: Big companies like Microsoft, as noted, created a sustainability data infrastructure (possibly internal "green ledger" concept). Also, BP and other energy companies have been working on blockchain pilots for tracking energy and carbon.
Hedera Guardian POC: Mentioned earlier, Hedera’s ESG public ledger proof-of-concept is a kind of research into how a public ledger might serve as a “planetary ledger” for climate assets/liabilities. That's preliminary work by a foundation.
Standards bodies early moves: IFRS’s ISSB is new but focusing on standards content, not data standards. However, XBRL International's Sustainability Working Group is likely working on taxonomy for ISSB standards. That's sort of implementing the concept. E.g., EFRAG and ESMA have a draft taxonomy for ESRS – that’s preliminary development of a digital format for lots of ESG data (not called "Green Ledger" but effectively a structured data approach).
The question mentions "ESG balance sheet research and who to involve", hinting some researchers or industry groups might have delved into the idea of an "ESG balance sheet" (like the multi-capital frameworks or some French academics).
Who should be involved:
Standard Setters: IFRS/ISSB (so that the data standard aligns with content standard), GRI, and others should be consulted to ensure it covers required metrics.
Regulators: like ESMA, SEC, etc., to align with what they'd accept in filings.
Technologists: XBRL experts, blockchain experts (like folks from the Hedera POC, or EA (Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) climate working group, etc.), to advise on best tech for ledger aspects.
Accountants and Auditors: Big Four sustainability practice leads, Institute of Internal Auditors (to incorporate controls perspective), professional accounting bodies (AICPA, IFAC).
Industry representatives: from sectors with heavy ESG reporting (energy, mining, consumer goods) to ensure practicality and that sector-specific data can be handled.
NGOs and Investors: groups like CDP, SASB (well, SASB folded into ISSB, but their expertise), Climate Action 100+ investor reps, to ensure the ledger captures what stakeholders want and builds trust.
Possibly software vendors like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft should be at table, since they'd implement it; also niche ESG software companies to incorporate their domain knowledge.
Roadblocks and pushbacks:
Complexity and Cost: Implementing a new data standard system-wide is not trivial. Companies might resist if they see it as another compliance burden without immediate ROI. Especially smaller companies or in regions with less regulatory pressure might push back or delay adoption. Similarly, initial setup cost and staff training can be barriers.
Standard Fragmentation: There's a risk of multiple competing frameworks or lack of global consensus (like earlier we have IFRS vs EU differences in standards, maybe similarly with data standards if not coordinated). If different regulators push different formats, it undermines the benefit of one standard. Achieving alignment is hard; it might face political pushback (some jurisdictions wanting their own way).
Data Sensitivity and Legal Liability: Companies might fear that providing highly detailed ESG data in a fixed record could expose them to legal risk (e.g., if data shows environmental law breaches clearly). So they might push back on making all data transparent. They might prefer narrative flexibility to manage perceptions – a structured ledger reduces that wiggle room (which is good for honesty, but companies may perceive it as risk). This could be analogous to earlier resistance to too much transparency in financial detail.
Technical capacity: Many companies (especially smaller or in developing markets) may not have systems in place. They might push back citing lack of IT infrastructure or skilled staff to implement a Green Ledger. Ensuring tools and support (and phasing it in) will be key.
Change Management and Cultural: Some sustainability teams are not as used to rigorous data systems as finance teams. They might find a ledger approach too rigid initially, or worry that their expertise (which often involves qualitative context) may be lost in pure data. So internal pushback from sustainability/CSR departments could occur if not included early and given adequate control to incorporate narrative as needed.
Prior failed standards memory: If older standards like XBRL GL didn't get huge traction, some might be cynical about a new one ("we tried something similar, no one used it"). Overcoming that requires showing what's different now (like strong regulatory support or pressing use-case).
Privacy and proprietary info: As mentioned, if a standard expects sharing of data considered proprietary (like granular supplier data or facility emissions in a way that might expose secrets or security info), companies might resist. Need to build in confidentiality options (like aggregated reporting or anonymity for certain sensitive pieces).
Lack of enforcement or incentives: Without push or pull, adoption can stagnate. If regulators don't enforce and investors don't reward it, companies might do minimal. There might be pushback in form of foot-dragging or adopting superficial compliance only (like producing a standard file that still doesn't include all needed data, akin to “compliance mentality” rather than true adoption).
Global scope vs local law: Multi-national companies might worry about data sovereignty issues (like environmental data could be considered strategic in some countries, though less likely than financial). Possibly concerns if storing data on international DLT or in centralized database could conflict with some local data regulations (like how some countries require environmental data to be reported locally first).
To navigate roadblocks, involve stakeholders as above so concerns are addressed in design, and possibly start with pilot programs to demonstrate value and refine before broad rollout (like how some jurisdictions tried pilot of SAF-T with volunteer companies first).
In summary, some groundwork is laid but more needed. The right people (standards bodies, regulators, industry, tech, investors) should collaborate to craft a usable standard. Potential obstacles range from technical to human factors, so a strategy to prove the concept value (maybe regulatory mandate combined with initial support to implement) will be critical. The carrot (e.g., streamlined reporting, positive investor interest) and stick (mandates) both likely needed to overcome inertia, akin to how financial XBRL only really took off when regulators required it.
