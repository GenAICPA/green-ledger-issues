## Short Answer

Both: sensors give objectivity; boundary choices remain subjective.

## Detailed Answer

Data fidelity in a Green Ledger has objective elements but also significant subjective aspects. By fidelity we mean the faithfulness of data – is it capturing reality accurately and reliably? In an ideal sense, one might think fidelity is objective (a fact is a fact). For example, a sensor reading of 50 kg of waste is an objective measurement. The ledger’s job is to record that correctly. To that extent, fidelity can be objective: the system can ensure data isn’t altered (especially if using tamper-evident logs or DLT) and that every entry is traceable to a source. Technology like distributed ledgers can provide objective proof of integrity (data hasn’t been changed) and completeness (all transactions are accounted).
However, much of sustainability data involves judgment calls, estimations, and methodological choices, making fidelity partly subjective. The measure of the fact often depends on point of view or chosen methodology. For instance, consider something like an organization’s carbon footprint: it’s not a directly measured single number but calculated based on models and emission factors. Two companies (or two regulatory regimes) might measure the same factory’s emissions differently due to including or excluding certain sources (e.g., one might count employee commuting, another might not). So the “factual” data in a Green Ledger often comes with qualifiers. An emission entry might be objectively captured given a certain protocol (say, GHG Protocol), but if a different protocol were used, the number could differ – indicating a subjective dimension in what is being measured.
There’s also perspective bias: as noted, what one entity or stakeholder views as an asset, another might view as a liability (Question 20 discusses the example of a government labeling something an environmental asset vs a subsequent government labeling it a liability). This suggests that whether data is considered “favorable” or relevant can be subjective. Even decisions on which indicators to include in the ledger are influenced by materiality judgments (which can be subjective and differ across jurisdictions – e.g., the EU’s double materiality vs U.S. single materiality approach).
In auditing terms, financial data fidelity is largely objective (with some estimates requiring judgment). For ESG, the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) recognizes that assuring sustainability information involves dealing with more subjective data. Efforts like the draft ISSA 5000 standard aim to bolster trust in sustainability info, but also note that information may be prepared under multiple frameworks and not everything is as cut-and-dry as financial figures.
So, we can say: A Green Ledger can implement objective controls for fidelity (like reconciliation checks, audit trails, independent verification) to maximize the objectivity of the data. But some aspects of ESG data will always be somewhat subjective or context-dependent – for example, the choice of a reporting boundary, the way to quantify a qualitative factor, or the assumptions behind a future-oriented metric. Stakeholders need to be aware of these and perhaps the Green Ledger needs to capture metadata about assumptions and methods to be transparent. In sum, fidelity is partly objective (especially for hard metrics that can be directly measured and verified) and partly subjective (in that what and how you measure can be driven by perspective or policy). Good design will strive to make subjective elements explicit (documenting definitions, methodologies) so that the ledger’s contents are trustworthy and understood in context.
