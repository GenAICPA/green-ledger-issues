## Short Answer

Attach control IDs and test evidence to every ledger entry.

## Detailed Answer

Yes, likely so. GRC-XML originally focused on linking controls to formal requirements (laws, regs, internal policies), including reputational risk to some extent. But sustainability is influenced by a broader set of external drivers beyond just black-letter law. Public sentiment, NGO campaigns, investor priorities, and market trends (like consumer preferences for green products) can all impose demands on a company, even if not codified in regulation.
Extending the model to these factors means the Green Ledger system could incorporate what we might call “soft requirements” or stakeholder expectations. For example:
If an influential NGO launches a campaign pushing for no new oil projects, a company might treat that as an external pressure to respond to (not a law, but it can affect reputation and market access). A GRC-like model for Green could allow tagging an issue like “stakeholder concern: community opposition to wind farm location” or “investor expectation: phase out coal by 2030” as something to track and address, much like a compliance requirement.
Reputational risk was already considered in GRC-XML, and indeed it asked “what about widely varying interests like solar vs wind preferences?”. This implies designing the ledger to handle diverse external inputs. For instance, classify external factors into categories: regulatory, market (customer/consumer preferences), reputation/social license, investor demands, etc. Each can be associated with certain data or controls.
If we incorporate this:
The Green Ledger might include entries or flags for issues like “company X has committed to no deforestation due to consumer pressure” – not law, but an external pledge. There could be an entry linking that pledge (driven by external interest) to relevant performance data (like tracking deforestation in the supply chain).
It could also mark out areas where external opinion diverges. For instance, solar vs wind: one community might prefer solar because wind turbines spoil landscape; another might prefer wind over large solar farms. If the ledger can capture stakeholder feedback (surveys, public hearing results), it could inform decisions and reflect those varying interests.
In practice, companies perform materiality assessments where they consult stakeholders to identify what issues are important to them. The output of that (material ESG topics ranked by stakeholder concern and business impact) is an example of an external driver mapping that isn’t a law but guides reporting focus. A GRC-XML style ledger could formalize those results: treat high-priority stakeholder issues as things to monitor and report on akin to compliance items. For example, if “biodiversity impact” comes out as key for stakeholders, ensure the ledger has an account for biodiversity metrics, even if no law mandates it yet.
Another scenario: widely varying interests in solar, wind can imply some stakeholders push for more solar projects, others worry about land use. This suggests the ledger might allow for scenario or alternative accounting – maybe tracking multiple pathways or preferences (like one ledger scenario with more solar, one with more wind) to show implications of different stakeholder preferences. While that might be advanced, it’s a thought for internal planning.
Also, consider future trends: Something like plastic pollution might not be heavily regulated now, but public sentiment is shifting. A forward-looking company could treat that as quasi-regulatory in planning – e.g., reduce plastics as if there is a regulation. The ledger could track progress on plastic reduction goals that are voluntarily adopted because external interest suggests eventual regulation or risk.
In essence, broadening the model means the Green Ledger can capture not just compliance but performance against social expectations or voluntary commitments. Many companies already set targets that exceed regulatory requirements due to stakeholder pressure (like net-zero pledges). These become internal “policies” but they originated from external drivers. So yes, the model should include those.
By doing this:
It improves transparency: stakeholders see the company acknowledging their concerns systematically, not just following the law.
It helps identify emerging risks/opportunities: early adaptation to stakeholder demands often gives competitive edge or avoids late-scramble when a soft demand becomes hard law.
It aligns with frameworks like double materiality: capturing not just what impacts finances (often regulated stuff) but what impacts society/environment irrespective of law.
So the ledger might have to be flexible and inclusive in its taxonomy. For example, have entries for “community complaints count” or “media sentiment score” etc. Those aren’t laws or internal controls, but they are triggers that might need a response (like a control could be “engage with community if complaints > X”).
In summary, extending the model beyond formal compliance to include other external demand factors is important for a Green Ledger. Sustainability is inherently driven by societal expectations and values, which evolve faster than laws. A truly effective ledger will track and classify these factors and the company’s response, not just tick the regulatory boxes. This means developing a way to formally represent stakeholder interests in the system – whether through added categories of 'requirements' (like treat a major customer’s sustainability requirement as a compliance item) or through linking risk entries to those interests (like reputational risk entries tied to trending issues such as wind vs solar preferences). The result is a ledger that helps navigate not just the letter of regulations but the spirit of what stakeholders desire.
