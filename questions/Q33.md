## Short Answer

Yes—voluntary pledges tracked alongside statutory disclosures.

## Detailed Answer

Absolutely, yes. Sustainability data can be sensitive or proprietary in some cases, and different stakeholders require different levels of detail. Therefore, building in a way to classify and segregate information by audience or confidentiality level is very important:
Internal-Only Data: Not all raw data may be suitable or necessary for public disclosure. For example, a very granular breakdown of waste streams by trace chemicals might be kept internal, with only high-level figures reported externally. Also, preliminary data or data that provide competitive insight (like specific efficiency techniques or supplier identities with issues) might be kept internal. A Green Ledger could tag certain entries as Internal so they don’t get published outside. This is similar to how financial systems keep transaction-level data internal, while only aggregated numbers go out.
Selective External (Partners or Regulators): Some information might be shared with regulators or business partners but not broadly public. For instance, detailed Scope 3 emissions by supplier could be shared with a customer under NDA, or detailed climate risk scenario data might be provided to a regulator confidentially (some climate stress tests, etc.). If the ledger can mark entries as For Regulator or Permissioned External, it can feed into regulatory reporting automatically without exposing it publicly. For instance, an entry could be “Detailed groundwater contamination readings (Confidential - Environmental Regulator Access)”, ensuring compliance reporting goes smoothly but not posted on the company website to avoid public alarm if not required.
Public Data: Many sustainability metrics should be transparent to all (GHG emissions, overall safety stats, etc.). Those would be tagged as Public, meaning they can appear in public sustainability reports or be shared with any stakeholder. The ledger might even have an online portal for certain public data if tagged appropriately.
Graduated Disclosure Over Time: Some data may be kept internal initially but later released as confidence grows or when issues resolved (“selectively unfolding to different audiences” over time as the question says). For example, early in a remediation, a company might internally track pollutant levels daily but only report monthly to regulators and annually to public. The design could accommodate that timeline, showing higher frequency data internally and summarizing externally.
Privacy and Compliance (PII/GDPR): If the ledger contains personal data (e.g., workforce diversity includes some personal sensitive info), it's crucial to manage who sees it. Tagging such data as Internal HR only vs Aggregated for public helps comply with GDPR etc. For example, individual employee health incidents are private, but total injury rates are public.
Competitive Sensitivity: If, say, the ledger tracks R&D on cleaner technology, raw data might reveal trade secrets or inefficiencies that competitors could exploit if seen. Thus classification ensures competitive sensitive info is not inadvertently disclosed.
Practically, implementing this could mean the Green Ledger has permission levels or views:
e.g., an Internal Green Dashboard that shows everything to management,
a Regulatory Report Generator that picks up all fields flagged for regulators and formats them accordingly,
and a Public Sustainability Report Export that only includes public-tagged items (perhaps aggregated).
This is analogous to financial reporting where internal management accounts have detail, regulators (like tax authorities) get certain detailed filings (SAF-T), and investors get the summarized financial statements.
Given digital reporting, one can even tag XBRL data with access levels and filter on that when publishing. It’s likely that some jurisdictions will allow confidential filings for certain ESG details (for example, the SEC climate rule proposals considered whether some location-specific data might be too sensitive to disclose publicly due to national security, etc.). Building classification in from the start future-proofs the system for such cases.
Also, selective unfolding to different audiences suggests maybe even within public domain, different audiences get tailored info:
Communities near a plant might want hyper-local data (e.g., emissions at that plant and health impact info) whereas investors want company-wide performance. The ledger might allow generating location-specific reports for local stakeholders (with data relevant to them) while still protecting sensitive info not needed by others.
Finally, audience-based classification fosters trust: If stakeholders know that when the company says "we have data on that but can’t release it publicly due to confidentiality", there's a system behind it (e.g., regulators have seen it), they might be more trusting. Like how financial markets know auditors see internal controls and granular data even if it's not all published.
In summary, embedding confidentiality and audience classification is crucial to meet legal requirements (privacy, security) and practical considerations (not overwhelming audiences with unnecessary detail or exposing sensitive information). It allows a single Green Ledger system to serve multiple reporting needs by filtering output per audience. This ensures maximum utility of the ledger internally, compliance with targeted disclosures externally, and proper transparency without oversharing.
