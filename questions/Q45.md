## Short Answer

Hashes on-chain, bulk data off-chain via resolvable URIs.

## Detailed Answer

Misunderstandings about what is actually stored on a blockchain vs off-chain references could lead to overestimation or underestimation of the system's capabilities and assurances, affecting design decisions:
Integrity vs Detail Misconception: Some may assume if something is "on blockchain" then all data is openly available and verifiable. In reality, often only a hash or pointer is on-chain for large or sensitive data, with the actual data off-chain (in a database or storage). If stakeholders believe the full audit trail is on-chain but it's actually off-chain, they might have false confidence. For example, a company might put a hash of their sustainability report on a blockchain to prove it wasn’t altered, but the actual data remains off-chain. If one doesn't understand that, they might think the blockchain itself stores all ESG performance data – and thus not maintain proper off-chain data management (assuming chain has it covered).
Verification Challenges: If the design chooses to only put hashes on-chain for efficiency, then verifying data requires retrieving the off-chain data and hashing it to compare. If a user or auditor doesn’t get that, they might either fail to verify properly or disregard the chain value thinking it’s incomplete. It's important in design to clearly communicate what is on-chain (e.g., "we store a cryptographic fingerprint of each monthly emission dataset on chain for integrity, while the dataset itself is in our database and accessible via permission").
Data Omission Risk: A ledger implementer might say "we'll use blockchain for our Green Ledger to secure it," but if they store minimal info on-chain (just summary numbers or hashes) and keep details off-chain without robust controls, someone might manipulate off-chain data and yet brag "it's on blockchain!" to seem secure. Misconception could lead to complacency: believing the blockchain ensures all data integrity, while off-chain data might still be vulnerable (if not properly protected and backed up).
Performance Expectation: People might think all data could/should be on-chain for transparency. In practice, putting huge ESG datasets (like IoT sensor streams) on a public blockchain would be impractical due to cost and speed. The design must balance what goes on-chain vs off-chain. If decision-makers misjudge that, they might either overload a chain or avoid using it at all thinking it can't handle the data, when a hybrid approach is intended.
Privacy Misconception: On a public chain, data is visible to all. Some may incorrectly assume putting data on a blockchain is private by default. This could lead to potential privacy breaches if personal or confidential ESG data is placed on a public DLT without encryption. Conversely, fearing any blockchain use because of public exposure might cause missing out on its benefits even when solutions (like permissioned chains or encryption) exist.
Auditor/regulator misunderstanding: If regulators expect all evidence on-chain but the system only puts digests on-chain, they need to know to ask for off-chain logs too. The ledger should incorporate clear linking between on-chain entries and off-chain detail, so nothing is lost in verification.
Solution: The design should incorporate education and clear documentation about which data is on-chain vs off-chain, and provide tools to seamlessly verify off-chain data integrity via the on-chain hashes. For instance, a UI that fetches the off-chain record and automatically compares with on-chain hash to say "Verified – matches blockchain record" helps non-technical users.
Impact on trust: Misconceptions could either inflate trust undeservedly or cause skepticism. If people think "blockchain = magic trust", they might overlook needed scrutiny of off-chain parts. If others think "blockchain is hype", they might not trust even the genuine integrity benefits it provides. So clarifying roles is crucial for proper trust calibration.
In context of a Green Ledger, that might mean:
If using DLT to log carbon credit transfers, ensure users know that maybe the certificate docs are off-chain but referenced by transaction ID, not stored on chain, etc.
If a company says "we put our environmental data on blockchain for transparency," the nuance is whether it's raw data or just summary or hash.
So, misinterpreting level-of-detail could lead to either design errors (like storing too much or too little on chain) or trust issues. The solution is to carefully decide which parts of the Green Ledger benefit from on-chain immutability (e.g., final confirmed figures, key certificates) and which remain off-chain (bulk sensor data, detailed internal analytics), and ensure the system bridges the two clearly.
In summary, misconceptions could impact how the ledger is built and perceived. Overcoming them means educating stakeholders and designing with clarity on on-chain/off-chain interplay: using blockchain where it adds value (integrity, consensus) and off-chain databases where needed (volume, privacy), and making the connections transparent and verifiable to users and auditors so the hybrid approach is robust and understood.
