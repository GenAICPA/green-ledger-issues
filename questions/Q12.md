## Short Answer

Yes—publishing granular facts reduces preparer bias but shifts work to users.

## Detailed Answer

It can help reduce subjective interpretation by the preparer and increase transparency, but it transfers the burden of interpretation to stakeholders. George H. Sorter’s Event Theory (from the 1960s) argued that financial reporting should move away from subjective income measurement and provide a chronology of events/facts that users can aggregate as they see fit. In a Green Ledger context, this would mean instead of companies providing highly processed sustainability metrics or single bottom-line figures (which involve subjective choices), they would disclose a rich dataset of underlying events: every emission source reading, every environmental incident, every kWh of renewable energy generated, etc. Stakeholders (investors, analysts, regulators, the public) could then slice and dice this data to draw their own conclusions, much as Sorter envisioned users creating their own financial statements from event data.
The advantage of this approach is freedom from the preparer’s bias. If a company reports only a summarized carbon footprint, it might reflect subjective boundaries or estimates. But if the company releases the raw data (say, emissions logs by facility and date, energy usage records, etc.), stakeholders could apply whatever emission factor or global warming potential they think is appropriate, test different assumptions, or aggregate emissions in categories they care about (e.g., by geography or product line) rather than what the company chooses to highlight. This level of detail certainly increases objectivity/transparency in the sense that the facts are laid bare. It’s analogous to open-source data: users are not forced to trust a potentially subjective summary.
For example, consider sentiment or reputation metrics: rather than the company giving itself a score or narrative (subjective), under an event approach, the company might provide raw data points like number of protests, social media sentiment scores each month, etc., letting users interpret if reputation is good or bad. Or in environmental terms, instead of reporting one aggregate “water risk score” that involves subjective weighting, provide all the underlying water usage and discharge data for each site, and let analysts apply their own risk models.
However, there are trade-offs. Volume and complexity of data become huge. Stakeholders need the tools and expertise to process raw data – not everyone can be their own data analyst. There’s a reason we summarize: to make information digestible. So while event-level disclosure reduces the company’s subjective filtering, it may introduce user subjectivity – each stakeholder might draw different conclusions from the same raw data. This isn’t necessarily bad (different stakeholders have different needs), but it could lead to inconsistency in interpretations if there isn’t some common ground.
A practical hybrid is emerging: digital reporting requirements (like XBRL tagging of sustainability info under CSRD) push companies to provide detailed tagged data that can be automatically aggregated by users. Some regulators might eventually require granular data submission (e.g., environmental permits often require detailed emissions logs to authorities). That aligns with the Event Theory spirit. Additionally, modern sustainability software often stores transaction-level records of ESG data (like each utility bill’s emissions, each trip’s mileage), even if the final report shows only totals – these systems could allow drill-down by auditors or stakeholders with access.
In summary, Event Theory in green reporting would indeed free the data from the company’s subjective summarizations, allowing stakeholders to interpret data in their own context. This likely improves overall objectivity/transparency of the reporting ecosystem. But it doesn’t entirely remove subjectivity – it just decentralizes it. Each user may apply subjective judgments in how they aggregate or what significance they attach to events. The approach also demands robust data platforms and perhaps agreed-upon data standards (so that users can make sense of events from different companies consistently). It’s a promising idea for the long term – in fact, the idea of open ESG data repositories and digital access is growing – but it needs to be balanced with usability. We might see a scenario where both occur: companies publish detailed data (for those who want to analyze deeply) and also provide some high-level indicators (for those who just need a quick view), with clear reconciliation between them. This dual approach would leverage Event Theory’s benefits while still providing some synthesis for convenience.
