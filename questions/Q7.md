## Short Answer

Mirrored receipts end dispute but do not guarantee measurement correctness.

## Detailed Answer

It could address certain problems, especially trust and verification issues, but it’s not a cure-all. Triple-entry accounting (i.e. using a shared ledger where each transaction between parties is recorded with a cryptographic receipt) offers a solution to problems of inter-entity trust, data integrity, and reconciliation. In sustainability reporting, one major challenge is verifying data that spans multiple organizations – for example, a manufacturer reporting Scope 3 emissions needs reliable data from suppliers. A shared ledger approach can ensure that each party’s entries are mirrored and cryptographically linked on a common platform, so they all see the same numbers and none can unilaterally alter the record. This can reduce errors from manual data exchange and prevent disputes (“my supplier says they emitted X, but my records show Y”). The consensus aspect of distributed ledgers means that once a sustainability-related transaction (like a carbon credit transfer or a delivery with an emissions value) is recorded, it’s locked in as an agreed fact among participants.
Such a system can help battle greenwashing and data tampering by providing transparency. For instance, researchers have noted issues like double counting of emissions reductions or credits – the same climate action being claimed by multiple parties. A triple-entry or DLT-based Green Ledger could be designed so that once a carbon reduction is recorded and “tokenized” on the ledger, it can’t be claimed twice (the ledger would reject a duplicate claim since the credit would already be accounted for). It basically acts as a central truth that all parties reconcile to, rather than each maintaining separate, potentially inconsistent ledgers.
However, implementing triple-entry in a Green Ledger also introduces new challenges. All parties must agree to use the system and trust its technology and governance. It may solve reconciliation and authenticity problems (integrity of data), but it doesn’t automatically solve measurement problems (e.g., if everyone agrees to a number that is wrong because of bad methodology, the ledger will faithfully reproduce that wrong number). Also, certain internal or subjective data points (like an internal risk assessment or a forward-looking estimate) might not have an external “counter-party” to mirror or validate them on a shared ledger.
In summary, a triple-entry (shared ledger) approach can be very helpful for aspects of Green Ledgers that involve multiple independent entities – ensuring a single, tamper-proof version of the truth and easing data integration across organizations. It directly tackles problems of trust and consistency across boundaries, which are significant in ESG reporting. But it should be seen as one tool among many: it helps with verification and transparency, especially for transactional ESG data (think carbon credits, energy usage data passed along a supply chain), while other problems (like how to quantify certain impacts) still need robust standards and audits. An example in practice is the Hedera-based ESG ledger, where the Layer-1 DLT (Hedera Hashgraph) ensures a globally auditable chain of custody for climate assets and liabilities, providing a level of trust and transparency that a traditional siloed system cannot easily achieve.
