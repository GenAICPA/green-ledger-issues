## Short Answer

Vendor ESG clouds converge on entity/metric/offset tables.

## Detailed Answer

A DLT ledger (like a blockchain or hashgraph ledger) shares the concept of being a record of transactions, but differs in structure and operation:
Decentralization vs Centralization: A traditional ledger (like an accounting GL) is centralized – maintained by one entity (the company) in a database or book. A DLT ledger is distributed across multiple nodes (computers) with no single authority exclusively controlling it. This means entries are validated by consensus of many participants rather than by a single bookkeeper.
Immutability and Trust: In a blockchain/DLT, once a transaction is recorded and confirmed, it's practically immutable (cannot be easily changed or deleted). This provides a high level of trust that the data hasn’t been tampered with. In contrast, a traditional ledger can be edited by those with access (though controlled by permissions). Immutability in DLT means strong data integrity, whereas in a normal database ledger, integrity relies on internal controls and audit trails.
Transparency: Public DLTs (like Ethereum, Hedera public network) are transparent – anyone can see the transactions (unless data is encrypted). A company’s ledger is private to itself and chosen stakeholders. Even permissioned enterprise blockchains share data among participants. So DLT can increase transparency across organizations by providing a common ledger accessible to all in the network.
Consensus and Verification: Each entry in a DLT is verified by multiple nodes through a consensus algorithm (proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, etc.) instead of by a central authority. This makes the ledger resilient to single-point failure or fraud by one party. In a traditional ledger, verification is through reconciliations, audits, etc., not built-in by technology to the same extent.
Detail and Data Structure: Traditional accounting ledger entries are typically at an aggregate level for financials (not every single sale as separate entry once posted to GL – many feed via subledgers). In DLT, every transaction (even micro ones) can be recorded if needed, but often DLT transactions are more granular or at least can carry extensive detail (though one might choose to store hashes of large data off-chain to reduce size). There's a misunderstanding sometimes that blockchain automatically tracks everything in detail; in reality, some solutions only store references or hashes on chain due to volume, which means the chain acts as a secure index to off-chain data. Traditional ledgers store the actual data in one system (no need to hash and reference).
Speed and Throughput: Traditional ledgers (databases) can handle thousands of transactions per second easily in an enterprise context; many DLTs (especially public ones) have lower throughput and higher latency (though some like Hedera or permissioned ones are improving). So real-time high-volume recording can be more challenging on DLT. For an accounting ledger, speed is rarely an issue since posting can be batch and local. DLT introduces overhead for consensus.
Smart Contracts vs Ledger Logic: DLTs can have smart contracts – code that executes on the ledger itself to enforce rules (like automatically releasing a payment when goods received recorded). Traditional ledgers rely on external software/applications to implement business logic and then record results. With blockchain, some logic can reside "on-ledger" enabling automated multi-party processes (like triggering a carbon credit retirement when emission recorded, etc.).
Security Model: Traditional ledger security is through central access control and backups. DLT's security is through cryptography and consensus – entries are cryptographically linked (hash chain) making them tamper-evident and resilient (no single node failure loses data if distributed properly). However, if one gets central credentials in a traditional ledger, they might alter stuff (if no controls); in DLT, to alter a past entry you'd need to override the entire network consensus (virtually impossible for large networks).
Finality and Correction: In accounting, you can correct entries by adjusting journals. In a blockchain, you can’t remove an entry, only append a new one that counteracts it if needed (similar effect: you can do a reversing transaction, which is akin to accounting practice too). But the immutability means the erroneous entry remains in history. That’s fine as long as you understand how to interpret (the chain is like an audit trail that cannot be cleared).
Participants and Multi-entity: A key difference is a blockchain ledger can be shared across multiple unrelated entities without trust. A traditional ledger is usually one company’s records. For multi-company processes (like supply chain, intercompany, external auditing), DLT can provide a common ground, whereas traditionally each party keeps their own ledgers and reconciles with others. That’s why triple-entry (blockchain) is called to reduce intercompany reconciliation – they share a third ledger entry.
Double-entry vs Single-entry on DLT: Many blockchains (like Bitcoin) use a UTXO model (not exactly double-entry in accounting terms, but each transaction ensures sum of inputs = sum of outputs, which is conceptually similar to debits=credits for that transaction). Some newer enterprise DLT solutions explicitly incorporate double-entry accounting logic (e.g., to model asset transfers like debiting one account and crediting another on chain). But the L in DLT stands for ledger – meaning it's conceptually similar (sequence of transactions) but implemented differently (distributed state replication). Yao Qian (cited in previous references) argued there's “no essential difference in accounting sense” but technically innovative features.
Overhead and Efficiency: Traditional ledgers are more efficient for internal use (no need for consensus overhead), but they rely on trust in the entity controlling them. DLT sacrifices some efficiency for trustlessness and shared truth.
So for a Green Ledger, using DLT might bring advantages if multi-party trust or public transparency is needed (e.g., verifying carbon credits, supply chain ESG data sharing), whereas a traditional ledger is fine for internal tracking and easier to query in detail.
In summary, DLT ledgers inherit the bookkeeping philosophy (recording every transaction in a chain) but add distributed trust, immutability, and multi-party consensus. Traditional ledgers are controlled, editable by owners, and rely on internal/external controls to assure accuracy. The DLT ledger can remove some of the need for external trust by design, but it’s not a replacement for double-entry logic—if anything, it’s a complement that can ensure double-entry records are unchanged and visible to all participants.
Also, as an analogy: a DLT ledger is like a shared ledger across a network, whereas a traditional ledger is typically siloed to one entity.
Both have roles: A Green Ledger could use traditional DB for internal detailed tracking and use DLT to share key verified results or tokens externally. It’s about using the right tool for the right scope.
