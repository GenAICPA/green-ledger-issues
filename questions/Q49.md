## Short Answer

Regulators, investors and supply-chains finally create adoption pull.

## Detailed Answer

A Green Ledger standard’s users would include:
Companies/Preparers: They would use it to internally organize and export their sustainability data efficiently. If mandated by government or demanded by investors, companies would adopt it to simplify reporting and avoid duplicative work. For instance, an EU company might use it to compile CSRD-required data, which could also feed investor requests, etc. Companies would favor it if it reduces their burden of customizing reports for each stakeholder (one standard data set can satisfy many). But if it’s too burdensome (like previous audit standards often failed due to cost vs benefit concerns), they might be reluctant.
Auditors and Assurance Providers: A standard data format would let auditors ingest ESG data into their analytics tools easily (like how SAF-T allows auditors to run analyses on tax data). Big audit firms would use it to streamline assurance tasks – e.g., automatically checking data quality, reconciling with financials. They’d push for it if it improves audit efficiency and quality. They were involved in XBRL GL and others; they might champion a Green Ledger standard, especially as ISSA 5000 will require a consistent approach. But if they recall limited success of earlier audit standards, they might be cautious unless there’s regulatory push.
Regulators: Governments and international bodies (like ESMA for EU, SEC for US, etc.) would be key users if they mandate it to collect sustainability filings. If, say, the EU requires submitting an XBRL data file for ESG, that’s effectively a standard in use. Regulators would like standardized data to better perform analysis, oversight, and to feed into aggregated national statistics (like climate target tracking). They might mandate it (which solves adoption issue as it becomes compulsory). However, regulators often proceed carefully – if they see industry spontaneously adopting a standard, they might piggyback on it.
Investors/Data Aggregators: Investors, ESG rating agencies, financial analysts – all currently spend lots of time gathering and normalizing ESG data from PDFs and websites. If a standard makes data machine-readable and comparable (like XBRL for financials), these users would enthusiastically use it. They might even demand companies provide data in a structured format to incorporate into their analysis models quickly. Companies could see that as a business case to adopt (to stay attractive to capital).
NGOs and Researchers: They could use standardized data to benchmark and hold companies accountable more easily (like ranking progress on climate across companies if all provide similar data points).
Software Vendors: ERP and reporting software companies would use the standard as a feature – they’d build modules to generate the Green Ledger outputs. Their support would help traction (as seen with SAP/Oracle, etc., aligning to regulatory standards like CSRD).
Why might it gain traction?
Regulatory Mandate: If a major jurisdiction (EU likely first) mandates digital ESG reporting in a certain format, companies under that jurisdiction will use it. That could drive global adoption if other regulators align (like the ISSB coordinating with EU).
Urgency and Public Pressure: Sustainability issues are high-profile. There is increasing demand for credible, comparable data to combat greenwashing. This momentum is stronger now than audit data standards (which were more internal/technical). A green ledger standard might be seen as part of the solution to transparency, thus garnering support from governments (for climate tracking) and investors (for portfolio alignment).
Technology Maturity: Past audit data standards like SAF-T or XBRL GL had moderate adoption. Lessons learned could make a new standard more user-friendly. Also, modern APIs, cloud platforms, and analytic tools might integrate a sustainability data standard more easily than past enterprise systems integrated XBRL GL.
Stakeholder coalition: If broad coalition (regulators, big companies, Big Four, investors) endorses a specific standard, it stands a better chance. The climate crisis urgency might achieve that coalition where audit domain didn’t quite unify (Engine B and others came from accounting firms, but lacked regulatory muscle behind them).
Cost-Benefit Perception: If companies see that adopting the standard reduces their reporting costs (one data prep to satisfy many stakeholders) and yields investor goodwill, they’ll be more inclined. This was an issue with earlier audit standards: many companies didn’t see immediate benefit to themselves, only to auditors or tax authorities. But with ESG, companies increasingly want to demonstrate transparency; a standard could ease that and improve credibility, which is a benefit to them (trust and potentially cheaper capital).
Traction Challenges: Many audit data standards had limited traction (XBRL GL, SAF-T beyond certain countries, etc.) because:
They were not mandated globally, only patchwork.
Implementing them was complex and not always prioritized by management (e.g., SAF-T often seen as compliance burden in each country).
There was lack of immediate value for preparers (they did it because required, not because it helped them).
For a Green Ledger standard:
If not mandated, companies might be hesitant to invest unless strongly demanded by investors or to ease multi-framework compliance. Many might continue using ad-hoc spreadsheets if allowed.
There is fragmentation risk: different regions might push slightly different standards (like ISSB vs EU differences), which could hamper a single standard’s traction (maybe multiple will exist).
Also, smaller firms could find it complex – need user-friendly tools to adopt it easily.
Traction enablers: Government and market alignment (e.g., ISSB + EU + big investors all saying “we need data in this format”), plus demonstration projects (like some large multinationals using it successfully and touting benefits) could drive network effect.
The name-dropping in Q49 suggests examples of standards with limited traction (UN/CEFACT, SAF-T, SIE, ISO 21378, Engine B). A lesson is many standards exist but few dominated due to lack of universal mandate or switching costs. To succeed, a Green Ledger standard might need a stronger push (maybe legally mandated as part of climate commitments or included in stock exchange listing requirements for ESG disclosure).
Another angle: There's public goodwill attached to climate transparency that wasn’t present for internal audit standards – so there might be more external pressure to adopt (e.g., climate activists praising companies that open their data).
In conclusion, such a standard would be used by a broad range of actors in the ESG ecosystem. Traction depends on combining forces of regulation, investor pressure, and clear benefits. Without those, it could languish like some audit data standards did. With them (and current momentum suggests it's possible, at least in some regions), it could see widespread adoption, potentially more than previous audit standards because ESG disclosure has become a mainstream expectation with multiple forces (not just auditors) pushing for it.
