## Short Answer

Public registries, CDP, rating agencies, future EU ESAP portal.

## Detailed Answer

Distributed ledgers (blockchains) are one way to store and share verified ESG data (and some projects use them to enhance trust), but reliable comparative ESG data is available from a variety of more traditional sources today:
Regulatory and Public Databases: Many governments maintain databases of environmental and social data reported by companies. For example:
The EU PRTR (Pollutant Release and Transfer Register) and country-specific PRTRs have facility-level emissions for major pollutants, allowing comparisons across companies or sites on pollution metrics.
The EPA’s TRI (Toxic Release Inventory) in the US provides similar pollutant data for manufacturing facilities. These are openly accessible and can be used to compare, say, chemical companies’ emission profiles.
Other examples: OSHA incident databases for safety in the US, national greenhouse gas inventories or registries where companies report CO₂ (e.g., mandatory carbon reporting schemes in UK, Australia, etc.). The upcoming EU Sustainability Single Access Point (ESAP) will aggregate corporate sustainability disclosures across Europe in one place, which will be a treasure trove of comparative data once running.
Industry Benchmarks and Studies: Some industry associations compile anonymized sustainability performance data. For instance, as early XBRL was inspired by RMA Statement Studies for financial ratios, we might look to:
WBCSD or sector initiatives: e.g., the Cement Sustainability Initiative had benchmarks for CO₂ per ton of cement among members.
The Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) provides a dataset comparing real estate and infrastructure firms on ESG factors.
These might not be public to all, but participants can compare themselves to industry averages.
ESG Rating Agencies / Data Providers: Firms like Bloomberg, Refinitiv, MSCI, Sustainalytics collect ESG data on thousands of companies globally and present it in comparable formats (often as ratings or scores, but also underlying data points). While these data are often proprietary and behind paywalls, they are widely used by investors for cross-company comparisons. For instance, Bloomberg’s terminal has an ESG function where you can view and compare companies on dozens of metrics (emissions, board diversity, etc.) using data aggregated from reports and other sources. These providers try to standardize disparate reporting into comparable metrics (with varying success).
Non-profits and Academic Databases:
The CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) database is a prime example. It has self-reported climate, water, and forest data for thousands of companies, standardized via its questionnaires. Researchers can access a lot of it (CDP often shares data with partners or on request) to compare performance (like carbon intensity across companies in a sector).
The GRI Database (hosted by GRI) lists thousands of GRI reports, though data isn’t fully aggregated, but tools are emerging to mine these reports for data.
Climate initiatives like Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) provide comparative assessments of companies’ carbon performance and targets against Paris-aligned benchmarks in high-emitting sectors.
Stock Exchanges and Reporting Repositories: Some stock exchanges require ESG reporting for listed companies and provide centralized availability:
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) for instance had an ESG guidance and its listed firms often in integrated reports.
The SSE (Shanghai/Shenzhen) have ESG info mandated for companies in China, often summarized in the CSR reports accessible via exchange or regulator websites.
In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority requires premium listed companies to report against TCFD and those reports are filed on official record (National Storage Mechanism).
Audit Data Standards and Repositories: While no global “sustainability SAF-T” exists yet, some initiatives hint at it:
The OECD’s SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax) concept could be extended to environment if tax authorities push for environment-related taxes.
The question explicitly hints at the lack of a parallel to SAF-T/ISO 21378 for ESG, meaning no single structured file format is mandated globally for ESG data extraction. But we do have emerging taxonomies (XBRL) and possibly something like the Climate Action Data Trust (CADT) which is a ledger of carbon credits bridging multiple registries (not corporate data per se, but environmental assets data for comparability of credits).
Company Sustainability Reports (as sources for comparison): Though manual, one can compare data by collecting from annual sustainability reports. Many big consultancies and rating agencies do this routinely. Efforts to scrape and structure these (e.g., ML tools that read PDFs and compile data) are under development.
Academic or NGO Tools: Some NGOs create comparative tools. E.g., the Climate Accountability Institute publishes rankings of top GHG emitting companies (the Carbon Majors report). There are also tools like the Environmental Paper Company Index comparing paper companies on metrics, etc.
In short, reliable comparative data exists in databases and repositories maintained by:
regulatory bodies,
collaborative disclosure initiatives (like CDP),
third-party data firms,
and increasingly via mandated digital reporting in standard formats.
While DLT can ensure integrity, one doesn’t strictly need blockchain to get comparative data – plenty is accessible via these channels. For immediate needs, one would go to CDP for climate data, Bloomberg/Refinitiv for broad ESG metrics, or regulatory registries for specific environmental data. These sources are being continuously enhanced and integrated (e.g., the EU’s coming single access point).
So apart from DLT, look to existing public disclosures and aggregated databases – they are the bedrock of current ESG comparability. For example, CSRD’s digital tagging will ensure data is machine-readable and comparable across companies and sectors, which is a near-term evolution making the data even more accessible.
