## Short Answer

RECs, recycling credits, nitrogen allowances, safety permits.

## Detailed Answer

Beyond carbon credits (which function as tradable assets and are often cited as a point-in-time balance), a few examples of stock measures in ESG include:
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs): Many companies obtain RECs to claim renewable electricity use. At any point, a company may hold a certain number of RECs in inventory. These are akin to a “green asset” that can be used or sold. They certify that 1 MWh of renewable energy was produced. While usually accounted when used against emissions, the holding itself is a point-in-time value.
Water Use Rights or Credits: In regions with water scarcity, companies might have water permits or credits (rights to withdraw a certain volume from a source). This is a resource held at a point in time. If systems like water credit trading expand, one could hold a balance of water credits similar to carbon credits.
Waste Recycling Credits: Some jurisdictions have “plastic credits” or other waste recycling credits. A company could hold credits representing a quantity of waste avoided or recycled, similar to carbon credits but for materials.
Biodiversity or Conservation Credits: Emerging markets for biodiversity offset credits or conservation banking are creating instruments that represent conservation outcomes (like habitat preserved). If a company invests in these, it could hold biodiversity credits as an asset (point-in-time) which it might later use to offset biodiversity impacts or sell. This is an evolving area, not as mainstream as carbon credits, but it’s analogous in concept (one credit = one unit of ecosystem benefit).
Social impact bonds or credits: Though not as standardized, consider if a company partakes in a scheme like purchasing “education credits” or “social value certificates” (these are not common yet, but conceptually could exist in impact investing or government programs). The company could hold a financial instrument tied to a social outcome at a given time.
Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) in loans: Some companies have sustainability-linked loans or bonds. While not exactly an “asset” you hold, at a point in time the company might have a liability adjustment pending its ESG performance. For example, a sustainability-linked bond might carry a coupon step-up if a target isn’t met by a certain date (point in time). One could imagine tracking that as a contingent liability from the ESG perspective on the balance sheet date (e.g., “as of now, we would incur a penalty of X because we’re off-target”).
Human Capital and Diversity Snapshots: These are point-in-time indicators (like percentage of women in management as of Dec 31 or employee engagement score at year-end). While not tradable or monetary, these are often reported as status at a point in time. For instance, a company may report it has 3,000 employees at year-end (headcount is a stock), with, say, 30% of them in R&D or 40% female – those are snapshot metrics.
Safety Stock Metrics: e.g., “Hours since last accident” or “Number of consecutive days without incident” at a particular date. That provides a sense of safety status at a point in time.
Cumulative Community Investments: Some companies track an accumulated total of community investment or donations (like an “ESG retained earnings” in philanthropy). For example, “total charitable contributions over the last 10 years = $X million.” On a given date, that cumulative figure is a stock (though one could also see it as retained outcome).
While the above vary in tangibility, the key is that ESG point-in-time values do exist but are less universally defined. Carbon credits stand out because they are quantifiable, tradable, and many companies have them. Other environmental credits (water, biodiversity) are emerging. Social side doesn’t have credits per se, but has snapshots of metrics (which we might not call “assets/liabilities” but they are balances or statuses).
Additionally, at a macro level, there are national or global ESG stock measures: e.g., the amount of carbon in the atmosphere at a given time, or the Earth’s remaining carbon budget at a year – but those are not company-level measures.
In conclusion, aside from carbon credits, renewable energy certificates and other environmental credits are analogous point-in-time ESG assets. Legal environmental provisions (for remediation, etc.) are point-in-time liabilities on financial statements with ESG significance. And a host of snapshot indicators (headcount, diversity figures, safety status) serve as point-in-time measures of ESG performance, even if they’re not framed as “balance sheet” items in the classical sense. The push toward multi-capital accounting may formalize more of these in the future (e.g., an “employee knowledge capital” index at a point in time, or natural capital balances), but for now the commonly recognized one in the corporate context is carbon credits/allowances.
