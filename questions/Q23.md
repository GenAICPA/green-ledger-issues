## Short Answer

Aligns with existing cycles; circular take-back adds new loops.

## Detailed Answer

We could see both approaches: some sustainability data will map onto existing business process cycles, and some “green processes” might be defined in parallel.
Many ESG impacts occur as part of normal business processes:
Procure-to-Pay: When procuring goods/services, there’s embedded environmental and social impact (supplier emissions, labor practices). A Green Ledger could latch onto this cycle by capturing data at procurement: e.g., every purchase order could carry an estimated carbon footprint of the item procured (some companies already do this for categories of spend). So you could integrate into P2P – effectively a sustainability subledger updating whenever payables are processed, capturing supply chain impacts.
Order-to-Cash: This covers production and sales. A Green Ledger might capture data in production (energy used per product, waste generated) and in distribution (emissions in delivering product). Also, the product use phase (customer use) is related to orders fulfilled. So, one might insert sustainability data capture in production orders or delivery notes. For example, when an order is completed in an ERP, the system could record not just the financial revenue but also the tons of CO₂ emitted fulfilling that order (derived from manufacturing data).
HSE (Health, Safety, Environment) processes: These can be seen as their own cycle – incident reporting and remediation could be a cycle (incident occurs -> record -> investigate -> resolve). A Green Ledger might follow that process, logging an event when an incident occurs (similar to recording a transaction).
Project lifecycle: If a company undertakes a big construction project, there’s a cycle (initiation, construction, operation). Sustainability data (like environmental impact assessments, community consultations) follow that cycle. The ledger might capture entries at each stage.
It’s possible to define “Green cycles” like:
Cradle-to-Grave (Lifecycle Assessment cycle): tracking a product’s environmental impact from raw material extraction (procurement) to manufacturing (operations) to use and disposal (customer end). This isn’t a business process per se (it spans multiple), but sustainability practitioners think in these terms.
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) for environmental management: an ISO 14001 management cycle. The ledger could align with the Check/Act parts by recording monitoring data and corrective actions.
However, likely a Green Ledger would largely tie into existing cycles because that’s where the data originates. For example:
Emissions data ties to operations (manufacturing cycle).
Supplier impacts tie to procurement cycle.
Customer product impacts tie to sales/use phase (which might require post-sale monitoring or studies).
Some sustainability processes cut across functional cycles. For instance, reporting and assurance is a process itself (collect data -> consolidate -> verify -> report) – that’s analogous to financial close process. One could consider that a “super cycle” culminating in the ESG report release.
The question suggests perhaps whether a Green Ledger is separate or integrated. Likely, integration with existing business cycles is key for adoption – you capture data at source. For example, SAP’s approach integrates carbon tracking into supply chain and financial processes. That suggests using the same transactional triggers.
At the same time, sustainability may introduce new cycles, like carbon management cycles (measure → reduce → offset), which overlay on business operations. These could be managed as separate workflows feeding the ledger.
So an answer: We would have analogous cycles in green, but many will be extensions of current cycles:
In procurement, a cycle of “supplier engagement”: identify supplier ESG data → collect → evaluate → act (like switching suppliers or helping them improve).
In product development, a “design for sustainability” cycle: concept → assess footprint → redesign → etc.
If we use the term “super cycles” from the question, some systems refer to Order-to-Cash + Procure-to-Pay collectively as major cycles. For green, maybe the “sustainability performance cycle” encompasses multiple business processes collectively.
One might also tie green metrics to the Plan→Budget→Execute cycle: for example, companies now plan carbon budgets similar to financial budgets, then execute and track actual vs budget.
In conclusion: Yes, likely analogous cycles or groupings would emerge. For instance:
Resource-to-waste cycle: tracking materials from extraction to disposal.
Employee lifecycle in ESG: hiring (diversity at intake) → training (human capital dev) → retention → exit (knowledge retained or lost).
But largely, the simplest way is to embed into existing cycles. That ensures sustainability is not siloed. For example, as operations run (which is an existing cycle), simultaneously update the “environmental ledger.”
So the design might not create wholly new cycles, but rather tie Green Ledger entries to points in current operational cycles. That said, if needed, we can define specialization like “Green subledgers per cycle”: a procurement sustainability subledger, a production sustainability subledger, etc. These effectively mirror the financial cycles but focusing on ESG data flows.
