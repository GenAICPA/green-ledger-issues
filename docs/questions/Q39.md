# Q39: Are there recognised sustainability charts of accounts or code sets, and how can they be incorporated?

## Short Answer

UN CEFACT, ISSB, ESRS code lists act as sustainability COA.

## Detailed Answer

The information flow of a Green Ledger could take several forms, and in practice a robust system will handle multiple flows:
Internal Aggregator (Internal-only target for internal & external connections): The Green Ledger might primarily live as an internal database that collects data from both internal sources (operations, HR, etc.) and possibly external sources (like supplier data, utility data) for internal use. In this mode, it's a central repository internally where data from outside (suppliers, sensors via IoT, etc.) is pulled in under control. It’s internal-only target with internal/external connections: external connections feed it, but it’s used internally to track performance and make decisions.
Permissioned Target for External Input: In some cases, external partners might directly input into the company’s ledger under controlled conditions. For example, a supplier could be given access to a portal to upload their carbon footprint info relevant to the company’s scope 3. That means the ledger acts as a permissioned target for external data. Only authorized partners (like key suppliers) can input, ensuring data integrity. This is already happening via supplier sustainability platforms (like CDP supply chain or SAP’s network).
Internal Source for Internal connections: The ledger will definitely serve as an internal source of information to internal systems: e.g., feeding risk management dashboards, feeding into management’s balanced scorecards, etc. It might connect to internal BI tools to analyze trends. It could also integrate with financial systems (e.g., internal carbon pricing might use ledger data to post internal charges).
Permissioned Source for External sharing: The company might share certain Green Ledger data with specific outsiders (with access control). For instance, sharing data with auditors (they get a direct feed of the ledger data needed for assurance), with regulators (via an automated filing, e.g., an API from the ledger to a government portal), or with major customers (who demand ESG data). This is a permissioned source scenario – only those given credentials or via secure channels get the data, not the general public. Blockchain-based solutions often implement this via permissioned DLT where only nodes or participants allowed can see data (ensuring, for example, privacy of sensitive data while still providing to those who need it).
Public (Permissionless) Source: Some information might be made openly available – a “permissionless source.” For example, a company might publish an open sustainability data API or contribute data to public repositories. If a Green Ledger is on a public blockchain, certain data might be inherently public (unless encrypted). The Hedera Guardian approach implies using a public ledger for tokenized environmental assets, which is nearly permissionless to read. A company might decide to put its verified carbon credits retirement on a public ledger as proof for all to see (like some do with blockchain carbon credit registries). Or a company could publish a subset of the Green Ledger (like key KPIs) on its website as open data. This is permissionless source accessible by anyone interested.
Likely, a comprehensive Green Ledger implementation might have a combination:
Internally, it's the single source of truth that consolidates all data (so internal target).
It accepts external inputs in a controlled way (supplier data ingestion, third-party data like weather or benchmark data ingestion).
It then acts as source for external reporting: producing files/data for regulators (like the XBRL for CSRD), for investors (maybe an Excel or XBRL summary for ESG rating agencies), and maybe raw data for stakeholders interested (some companies provide data to ESG data platforms voluntarily).
The design should consider data security and confidentiality in each flow (as we addressed in Q33). E.g., if sharing publicly, strip PII or sensitive details; if sharing with regulator, ensure secure transfer etc.
One could imagine:
Scenario: The Green Ledger is implemented on a permissioned DLT where the company, its auditors, and regulators are nodes (so they all see certain data). Meanwhile, a public summary ledger is posted (like a sustainability report in machine-readable form) for general audience.
Thus, a mixture: internal-only for most detailed data, permissioned for partners/regulators, and possibly permissionless for high-level verified data (like “DLTs are about ledgers; how does a DLT ledger compare… misunderstanding detail on chain vs off chain” relates; that suggests maybe only hashes or proofs might be on public chain, with detail off-chain accessible in permissioned manner).
So to directly answer:
Internal Only Target from Internal/External connections: Yes, it will aggregate internal data and may pull external data in (e.g., industry benchmarks, supplier submissions).
Permissioned Target from External connections: Yes, e.g., a supplier portal feeding the ledger, or IoT devices (external in a way) feeding it.
Internal Only Source to Internal connections: Yes, it will feed internal analytics, risk, and strategy processes.
Permissioned Source to External connections: Yes, e.g., direct data feeds to regulators, investors upon request, etc. Many companies already give tailored data to certain customers (like product footprint data) – the ledger can automate that.
Permissionless Source to Internal/External (Public): Possibly for the open portions. It’s like making part of the ledger public domain (some companies open source certain ESG data for transparency, akin to what some in tech do with energy usage – publishing raw data sets for research).
Designing for these flows means having good data governance: knowing which data goes where and controlling access.
Given the emphasis on transparency nowadays, I suspect an ideal Green Ledger tries to push as much as feasible to the public domain to build trust (permissionless), while protecting what must be protected via permissioning. With digital frameworks, it's easier to have multi-tier disclosure (like an XBRL report can contain more data than what’s visible in the PDF report; regulators might see hidden tagged info, whereas public only sees summarized).
In conclusion, the Green Ledger should be flexible to operate in all those modes. It might initially be internal-focused (like companies first gather data internally), but as trust and systems mature, more direct external data exchange (both in and out) will occur, culminating in possibly some real-time public disclosures for key metrics (like some companies show live environmental data on websites nowadays for certain sites – effectively a public ledger of emissions at that site).
