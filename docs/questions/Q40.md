# Q40: What information-flow patterns should a Green Ledger support (internal, permissioned, public)?

## Short Answer

Support internal, B2B APIs, regulator filings and open feeds.

## Detailed Answer

It’s quite plausible that a Green Ledger should support multiple “views” or parallel sets of records for different purposes, analogous to keeping multiple sets of books in accounting (one for GAAP, one for tax, one for management). Reasons:
Different Reporting Frameworks/Standards: A company might report sustainability information under, say, GRI for a CSR report, and also under SASB or ISSB for investors, and maybe under regulatory ESRS for European filing. Each framework might have slightly different scope or metrics definitions. Rather than completely separate systems, a ledger could maintain essentially the same underlying data but “slice” or adjust it for each standard. In some cases, adjustments are needed. For instance, internal vs external boundaries: maybe internally the company tracks impacts of its entire value chain, but statutory reporting might only require certain scopes. Or vice versa: regulatory may demand a certain organizational boundary (like only parent company), whereas management looks at full group including JVs.
Book vs Tax analogy: Think how companies keep a fixed asset ledger for financial depreciation and another for tax depreciation. In ESG, consider GHG accounting: a company might use one method for voluntary reporting (market-based emissions factors for electricity), but regulators might require location-based factors. They might maintain both sets. Similarly, internal carbon pricing might count certain emissions differently (maybe they set an internal boundary broader than regulation).
Management (Operational) vs Statutory metrics: Management might want to include certain indicators not required in formal reports, or use different KPIs. For example, management might track “net water consumption” including recycling, whereas a government report might only ask for gross intake. The ledger could carry both values (one as management measure, one as regulatory measure).
Reconciling multiple sets: XBRL GL’s multi-book feature allows tagging entries as belonging to different reporting bases. A Green Ledger could let each data entry be labeled by which “book” or framework it applies to. Some entries might exist in all (e.g., total Scope 1 emissions likely same for all frameworks), but others might differ (like how to account for a partially owned facility’s emissions: include for management, exclude for certain external reports, etc.). The system could then generate each report from the relevant set of entries. This avoids double data maintenance — changes update across books where linked.
Reconciliation: If multiple sets are kept, the ledger can also facilitate reconciliation statements explaining differences. For example: “Our internal energy use includes our leased facilities too, which adds X MWh, not included in statutory scope.” That reconciliation can be systematically derived if both books are in one system.
Statutory by region differences: Possibly needed if a company must file different ESG reports in different jurisdictions with slightly different rules (like the EU vs U.S. differences – maybe EU requires reporting certain social metrics under CSRD that SEC does not, or vice versa with climate details). Instead of two separate systems, one ledger could produce both by storing whatever extra detail is needed with tags for each jurisdiction’s report.
Audit trail: Auditors could see all books to ensure consistency and that differences are intentional and documented, similarly to how audit looks at book vs tax differences for tax footnotes.
Multiple targets (like cooking the greens risk): If unscrupulous, a company might be tempted to present a rosier picture to public vs management gets the real data (or vice versa). The ledger should ideally maintain all in one place to discourage that (transparency internally that differences exist and why). It’s better to deliberately maintain two labeled versions than inadvertently have inconsistent data.
The question specifically notes XBRL GL can track multiple sets (book vs tax vs mgmt) and asks if Green Ledger should do similarly (book vs management vs statutory etc. recognition). The likely answer: Yes, to accommodate different recognition rules or objectives, it should.
A concrete example: Many companies set internal carbon prices for decision-making that may account for future regulatory costs or societal costs. They might maintain an internal “shadow carbon cost ledger” that isn’t reported outside. That’s a parallel “book” (monetary representation of carbon impact vs actual financials).
Another: A company might commit to science-based net-zero including supply chain (that’s internal target “book”), but legally they might only be accountable for their direct emissions now. Having parallel records helps manage to both targets.
So, Yes, a Green Ledger should be able to keep different but reconciled entries for different purposes:
One for internal (maybe more comprehensive or experimental measures),
one aligning to each significant external requirement (e.g., regulatory submission, voluntary frameworks).
The design can link entries when they’re basically the same measurement, and separate when definitions differ. XBRL GL’s approach of labeling entries by “book code” could be mimicked with a dimension for “Reporting Standard” on each data point.
To ensure consistency, any difference should be explainable. E.g., if management scope includes JV emissions and statutory excludes them, the ledger can include an entry like “Emissions from JV X: 100 tons (included in internal, excluded from statutory)” with a flag to include in one set and not the other.
In summary, the flexibility to maintain parallel records would make the Green Ledger much more useful and reduce error when meeting various reporting needs. Otherwise, companies might resort to separate spreadsheets for each report, which is what we want to avoid. The ledger, as central repository, should generate multiple outputs as needed, akin to multi-GAAP financial consolidation systems.
So indeed, designing with that in mind is prudent, and XBRL GL shows it’s feasible by tagging entries. This ensures we don't have to “cook the greens” (manipulate data selectively for each audience) because differences are explicit and controlled, not ad-hoc.
