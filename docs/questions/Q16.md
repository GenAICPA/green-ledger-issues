# Q16: Which point-in-time concepts (assets/liabilities) exist in sustainability reporting?

## Short Answer

Carbon credits, RECs, water-rights, provisions, biodiversity offsets.

## Detailed Answer

There are a few point-in-time (stock) concepts in ESG, but they are less standardized than financial balance sheet items. Typically, sustainability focuses on flows (activities over time) – e.g., annual emissions, yearly energy consumption, injuries during the year, etc., akin to an income statement. The question asks: what about point-in-time measures (like a balance sheet’s snapshot of assets/liabilities at a date)?
Some examples of point-in-time ESG concepts include:
Carbon Credits or Emission Allowances: This is a clear one. If a company participates in a cap-and-trade system or voluntary carbon markets, at any given point it holds a certain number of carbon credits/allowances. These can be seen as assets on a sustainability balance sheet (they represent a license to emit or a claim on someone else’s emission reduction). Indeed, carbon credits are often accounted as intangible assets or inventory in financial terms. For ESG purposes, they’re a store of environmental value. A company with a surplus of allowances has an asset; one with a deficit (needing to buy or facing penalties) has a sort of environmental liability.
Environmental Provisions/Liabilities: In financial reporting, companies do record environmental liabilities at a point in time – for example, the obligation to remediate a contaminated site or decommission assets (like oil rigs) at end of life. These are often quantified and put on the balance sheet (e.g., a mine reclamation provision). In ESG terms, these could be highlighted as well – essentially a future environmental cost the company is responsible for. It’s a liability in both financial and sustainability senses.
Natural Capital Assets: Although not typically on corporate balance sheets, one could conceptually have “assets” like a forest a company owns (which sequesters carbon) or water rights. For instance, a timber company might treat the forest as an asset in an environmental sense (stock of trees at a given date). Some companies in their sustainability reports talk about “natural capital” in stock terms – e.g., hectares of land under conservation, volume of water in reservoirs, etc., at period end.
Social Capital or Human Capital Stocks: Similarly, point-in-time social metrics could be considered: number of employees at the end of the period (with breakdowns by diversity categories – arguably a “human capital asset” in a sense), or the accumulated goodwill/reputation capital with stakeholders (though that’s hard to quantify, sometimes brand value is considered a proxy). The question in ESG is how to measure these in units. We do have end-of-period values like employee headcount, diversity percentages, community trust survey scores at a point in time – these are snapshot indicators.
Sustainability Reserves/Budgets: There’s an idea of an “emissions budget” – e.g., a company might have a remaining budget of X tons of CO₂ it can emit in the future to be aligned with a certain climate goal. You could treat that remaining budget as a finite resource as of today (a bit like remaining oil reserves, but in reverse – a reserve of permission to emit). This isn’t commonly reported as a number, but conceptually it’s a point-in-time stat (today we have 5 million tons left in our 5-year carbon budget, tomorrow slightly less after we emit some).
Beyond carbon credits, other point-in-time ESG values are not as commonly formalized. However, some could be:
Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs): Similar to carbon credits, a company can hold RECs at a given time (which are claims to renewable power generation). They often apply those to a year’s footprint, but at any moment they have a certain inventory of RECs (an asset).
Permits and Licenses: A company might have permits (like a permit to discharge a certain pollutant up to a limit). The existence of unused permitted capacity at a point could be considered a “latent asset” environmentally (though one hopes they don’t use it fully).
Patents for green technology: Intellectual property that enables sustainable solutions – not usually framed as ESG assets, but they are assets that can contribute to sustainability.
The question likely expects the identification that aside from carbon credits, few ESG items have been treated like balance sheet items. Carbon credits are indeed the standout example. Also, “Carbon debt” is sometimes used to describe the accumulated emissions a company has put in the atmosphere historically (which could be viewed as a liability to society). Some have proposed companies might one day report their cumulative emissions since a baseline (like retained earnings of carbon). This is not standard yet, but it’s an interesting point-in-time concept: e.g., Company X has an “emissions legacy” of Y million tons since inception.
In summary, yes, there are point-in-time ESG concepts: carbon credits (and similar environmental instruments) are the clearest stock items. Other than that, ESG “assets” and “liabilities” tend to be conceptual: environmental liabilities (obligations) are somewhat recognized; positive assets like “community goodwill” are not quantified in the same way. Efforts in sustainable accounting are ongoing to develop something like a sustainability balance sheet, but it’s early (see Appendix on multi-capital accounting). So, other well-known point-in-time measures beyond carbon credits might include renewable energy certificates, water rights allocations, or biodiversity offsets (emerging markets for biodiversity credits) – each giving a snapshot of what the company holds in terms of sustainability value or obligations at a given date.
