# Q25: Who are the actors in the Green Reporting Supply Chain, and how do they interact?

## Short Answer

Preparers, assurers, regulators, data vendors, NGOs, investors, tech providers.

## Detailed Answer

The “Green Reporting Supply Chain” (GRSC) involves all the actors who play a role in producing, assuring, disseminating, and using sustainability information. It parallels the XBRL Business Reporting Supply Chain (which includes preparers, auditors, regulators, data aggregators, and users such as investors), but with some specialized roles and possibly additional players. Key participants include:
Preparers (Company Management and ESG Teams): These are the organizations that measure and report sustainability data about themselves. Within a company, this includes the sustainability or ESG reporting team, environmental health & safety (EHS) managers, HR for social data, finance teams integrating ESG into reports, etc. They collect data from operations, suppliers, etc., and compile the Green Ledger and sustainability reports.
Internal Assurance / Sustainability Controllers: Many companies now have internal control functions for non-financial data (similar to controllers for financial data). They ensure data quality before it goes out. This could be considered part of the preparer segment, but worth noting as those who verify internally.
External Assurance Providers (Auditors and Certifiers): Independent auditors (which could be the Big Four or specialized firms) who provide assurance on sustainability reports. This may also include certification bodies for specific standards (e.g., an ISO 14001 certification body verifying environmental management systems, or a GRI report being externally assured). They play the trust-building role akin to financial auditors, checking that the Green Ledger entries and reported metrics are accurate and in line with standards.
Regulators and Standard-Setters: Entities like ESMA or national securities regulators who mandate the reporting format (e.g., ESMA will mandate digital tagging of CSRD reports), as well as environmental regulators who might require data (like EPA requiring emissions data). Also included are standard-setting bodies like the ISSB (setting IFRS Sustainability standards), GRI, SASB (now part of ISSB’s VRF), and the EU’s EFRAG for ESRS. They provide the rules of the game (what needs to be reported, how to measure it). In the supply chain metaphor, they are upstream of preparers, influencing what is reported, and downstream receiving the data (regulators use the data for oversight).
Data Aggregators and Platforms: In financial supply chain, data aggregators (like Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters) take XBRL financial data and distribute it. In the Green context, we have specialized ESG data providers (MSCI, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg ESG, Refinitiv, S&P Global, etc.) that gather sustainability info from reports and sometimes directly from companies. There are also centralized platforms emerging: e.g., the European Single Access Point (ESAP) will collect all financial and ESG filings in the EU for public access, and CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) collects climate data from companies and provides a database to investors. These act as intermediaries, collecting data from preparers and delivering to users in a structured way.
Users of ESG Data: This is a broad group:
Investors and Analysts: Portfolio managers, analysts, rating agencies that incorporate ESG into valuations or credit ratings. They use the data to make decisions about investment, lending (banks considering climate risk), etc.
Ratings and Ranking Organizations: Entities that use the Green Ledger info to rate companies (e.g., ESG rating agencies or indexes like DJSI – Dow Jones Sustainability Index – which evaluate companies based on sustainability performance).
Civil Society and NGOs: Environmental and social NGOs, activist groups, and journalists are key users of sustainability info. They might use the data to hold companies accountable or to advocate for change. For instance, an NGO might comb through emissions data to call out top polluters or verify if companies are meeting pledges.
Customers and Business Partners: Large companies often want data from their suppliers (supply chain transparency), and consumers are increasingly interested in product sustainability information (like carbon footprint on labels). So B2B and B2C users are part of the chain – for example, a manufacturer might require suppliers to report via a platform (this makes the manufacturer both a preparer of its own data and a user of upstream data).
Employees and Job Seekers: Current and prospective employees use sustainability data to gauge company values and risk (e.g., younger workforce might choose employers with better ESG reputations).
Regulators (again) as Users: Regulators not only set rules but also use reported data to enforce laws or shape policy. E.g., if companies report high pollution, an environmental agency might take action or if climate risk data shows systemic risk, financial regulators may intervene.
Technology Enablers: This might not traditionally be listed as part of supply chain, but in digital reporting, the software providers (companies that provide sustainability management software, XBRL tagging tools, blockchain networks like Hedera used for ESG data, etc.) are crucial participants enabling the flow of data. XBRL taxonomies, data standards developers, etc., also fall here.
In summary, the Green Reporting Supply Chain includes all roles analogous to financial reporting plus some expanded stakeholders:
Preparer companies (and their internal contributors).
External verifiers (audit firms, etc.).
Regulators & Standard bodies (like ESMA, ISSB, GRI, etc., plus government agencies).
Data infrastructure providers (consultants, software, XBRL organizations, etc., enabling the reporting).
Data aggregators and repositories (CDP, Bloomberg, future ESAP).
End-users: investors, analysts, NGOs, communities, customers, academics (who might do research on the data), and employees.
These participants form a chain where sustainability information is generated, validated, transmitted, and ultimately utilized in decision-making and accountability, just as financial info flows from company books to audited reports to databases to investors – but with perhaps even more diverse endpoints given the public interest in sustainability.
