# Q48: Can XBRL GL’s multi-books capability accommodate potential regional differences?

## Short Answer

XBRL GL mirrors events into unlimited classification views.

## Detailed Answer

Yes. XBRL GL (Global Ledger taxonomy) provides a flexible framework for representing ledger entries that is not tied to a specific chart of accounts structure or accounting standard. It uses a rich set of generic fields (like Account, Subaccount, etc.) that can be used or ignored depending on local practice, and it supports linking to master files (customers, projects, etc.) separately. This flexibility was key to enabling data exchange across different accounting systems.
Applying that idea:
A Green Ledger could use a similarly generic data model where key dimensions (like organizational unit, location, category of metric, time period) are represented in a flexible way. For example, if Europe typically encodes facility in the account code (like “Emissions_EUPlant01_CO2”), and US would store facility as a separate field, the data model should have separate fields for each aspect (one field for metric type, one for facility, etc.), and allow them to be concatenated or kept separate as needed.
XBRL GL also allowed multiple "contexts" for entries. In a Green Ledger, one might have multiple contexts like we discussed (internal vs external, different frameworks). The GL approach to context (like specifying which standard or currency etc. an entry uses) can be borrowed to tag sustainability data with context (like which framework or region it is meant for).
The fact XBRL GL is a standard for granular data means possibly we could directly use or extend XBRL GL to include sustainability facts. There's talk in accounting circles of integrating financial and non-financial data. XBRL GL already has some fields for generic measurements that could be leveraged. If not directly, its approach to extensibility (it’s easily extendable to new fields) could allow a Green Ledger taxonomy to sit on top, or side-by-side, with GL, ensuring that if some regions embed sustainability in financial accounts (like "environmental liability accounts"), those can travel in the same file with both financial and sustainability data.
The principle of accommodating different levels of detail: Some regions might want transaction-level environmental data, others only aggregated. XBRL GL handles a full ledger transaction dataset but one can also send summary. Similarly, a Green Ledger format should allow both detailed and summary reporting. XBRL GL’s model can be scaled from transaction to summary trial balance; we could conceive a Green Ledger that can hold raw data (like emissions from each device) but also just totals if that’s all that’s available, without breaking the format.
Another feature: XBRL GL is system-agnostic and multilingual (it can tag things with multiple languages). That helps with regional differences in language or labels.
By leveraging XBRL GL, or at least its philosophy, a Green Ledger can avoid being too rigid or tailored only to one region's practices.
Also, if one region (like Europe) uses master data approach (like separate dimension for "Facility"), and another might conceive it differently, a robust schema can capture facility either as a dimension or part of an account string – XBRL GL had concept of "account segments" vs separate fields. A Green Ledger could allow either approach but still standardize the eventual output by mapping segments to defined fields.
In practical terms:
If XBRL GL covers base financial info, maybe the Green Ledger design could literally extend XBRL GL to include environmental metrics as "measures" or "quantities" associated with entries. There's concept of XBRL GL "measure" for physical quantities (like inventory count or hours) that could be repurposed for, say, "CO2 mass" with appropriate unit.
If a company uses one integrated system for both, aligning with XBRL GL means easier integration with their accounting data flows.
So yes, XBRL GL’s adaptability is a model: it shows how to build a ledger standard that isn't biased to one country's way of bookkeeping. We should similarly ensure the Green Ledger standard is not biased to one region's ESG approach.
Given XBRL GL explicitly mentioned accommodating differences between European vs US ledger style, we can directly say: We can carry over that concept. For example, treat sustainability metrics as facts that can be classified by multiple dimensions (like region, facility, category) rather than encoding them in one classification, so each region can retrieve or present data as they prefer without altering the underlying dataset.
Finally, by using something like XBRL GL, one could package detailed ESG data in a standard file and send it to auditors or regulators, regardless of how it was recorded internally. That is beneficial internationally.
Thus, the same flexibility that allowed XBRL GL to unify different accounting systems can help unify different sustainability reporting practices. It would facilitate companies operating globally to use one internal ledger and map to various external requirements smoothly.
