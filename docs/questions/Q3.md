# Q3: Which bookkeeping models—single, double or triple entry—best serve sustainability data?

## Short Answer

Double-entry secures internal integrity; triple-entry receipts add cross-party trust.

## Detailed Answer

Single-entry bookkeeping records each transaction only once (like an income or expense in a checkbook). It is simple but prone to error and harder to audit, since there’s no automatic cross-check. In a single-entry system, one can alter or omit a transaction with little trace – e.g. “remove a line in the ledger and that money no longer exists, with no way to verify or audit”. Double-entry bookkeeping, by contrast, records two entries for every transaction (debit and credit) in equal amount. This self-balancing method (debits = credits) introduced in the 15th century greatly improved accountability: discrepancies become evident if books don’t balance, providing an internal check against errors or fraud. Double-entry is the backbone of modern financial accounting – it enforces the basic accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) at all times.
Triple-entry accounting is an extension wherein transactions between two parties are cryptographically sealed and recorded on a third, shared ledger (often a distributed ledger or blockchain). Each party still records the transaction in their own books (debit/credit), but a third entry – a digitally signed receipt of the transaction – is added to an immutable common ledger. This innovation (conceptualized in the 1980s and popularized by blockchain technology) provides an extra layer of trust: once recorded in the third ledger, a transaction’s details are time-stamped and cannot be tampered with without detection. In summary, single-entry logs facts in isolation, double-entry links facts in balanced pairs (ensuring consistency within one entity’s books), and triple-entry links records across entities on a secure common platform (ensuring consistency and trust between parties).
