# Q26: Is the Green Reporting Supply Chain a subset, superset, or overlap of the business-reporting supply chain?

## Short Answer

Overlap that broadens the classic business-reporting chain.

## Detailed Answer

The Green Reporting Supply Chain overlaps heavily with the traditional financial reporting supply chain, but it also brings in some additional players and relationships, making it in some ways a superset of the traditional chain:
Overlap: Many participants are the same. Companies (preparers) are the same entities now preparing two kinds of reports; accounting firms are now auditing both financials and ESG; regulators (like securities regulators) are extending their remit to sustainability disclosures (ESMA, SEC proposals on climate). Investors and analysts increasingly look at both financial and ESG data side by side. So there’s a large overlap – the core infrastructure (report production and review processes, and many user groups like investors) are shared or analogous.
Additional Participants (Superset elements): Green reporting involves some stakeholders not typically engaged in financial reporting:
Environmental and Social Regulators: e.g., environmental protection agencies, labor standards bodies. Financial reporting supply chain deals mainly with financial regulators (SEC, etc.), whereas sustainability data might also be consumed by environment ministries or international bodies tracking climate targets.
NGOs and Civil Society: While NGOs might indirectly use financial reports for their work, they are not primary users of financial statements. But they are often primary consumers and watchdogs of ESG data. This brings a new dynamic – public scrutiny and pressure via NGOs is much more prominent in ESG supply chain.
Supply Chain Partners: In financial reporting, one company’s financial info isn’t directly used by its suppliers or customers in a collaborative way (except maybe credit analysis). In ESG, there’s a concept of value-chain reporting – a company needs data from its suppliers (Scope 3 upstream emissions, labor practices) and provides data to its customers (product footprints). So companies are both preparers and users of each other’s ESG data. This interconnected relationship is stronger in green reporting. It means the GRSC has a more networked character rather than linear: Company A’s report relies on data from Company B (supplier), etc. This makes it in a sense a superset, since in financial reporting, one company’s reporting doesn’t typically feed directly into another’s (aside from consolidation of a corporate group).
Data Initiatives and Collaboratives: We see emergence of industry collaborations for ESG data (e.g., PACT for carbon data, or the Science Based Targets initiative where companies share information). These collaborative platforms are something not present in traditional financial reporting (companies don’t typically collaboratively report financials).
Standard diversity: Traditional financial reporting supply chain globally is dominated by a couple of standards (IFRS or US GAAP). In ESG, there’s a patchwork of standards (GRI, SASB, TCFD, etc., now converging maybe, but still multiple). So the supply chain is more complex with multiple frameworks – meaning companies often produce multiple reports for different audiences (one for investors, one for broad stakeholders, etc.). One could say the GRSC has multiple “supply chains” for different frameworks that overlap at the company. That broadens its scope.
User Diversity: Financial info is mainly for investors/creditors (though also regulators and management). ESG info is explicitly for a wider set: communities, consumers, NGOs, in addition to investors. This means the GRSC has more varied expectations and ways data gets used (e.g., a municipality might use companies’ pollution data to shape policy, consumers might use product sustainability data to choose what to buy – those are uses beyond the classic investor-centric model).
Because of these additions, one could consider the Green supply chain a superset of the traditional one. It includes everything in financial reporting (since integrated reports now combine them, and much of the infrastructure is shared or analogous) but extends to new domains.
However, one might also argue it’s an overlapping set: some financial chain participants might not play in ESG yet (for instance, credit rating agencies were part of financial chain, but now actually they are — they have ESG ratings arms, so yes they are in ESG too). Perhaps certain data vendors specialized in ESG are new, but financial data vendors quickly absorbed ESG data into their offerings.
A notable difference: Government policy linkages. Business reporting supply chain was mostly about disclosure compliance and capital markets. Green reporting supply chain connects to government policy goals (like Paris Agreement climate goals). So the output of ESG reporting feeds into governmental tracking of NDCs (national determined contributions for emissions). So national/international bodies (UN, etc.) become end-users in a way. That again is an extension beyond typical financial supply chain.
In terms of subset vs superset:
If we consider only capital-market oriented ESG reporting (like ISSB standards aimed at investors), that supply chain is pretty much the same actors plus maybe ESG rating firms.
But if we consider broader sustainability reporting (like GRI aimed at stakeholders), then yes, far more players (NGOs, communities) are involved.
Thus, the Green Reporting Supply Chain is broader (a superset) compared to the Business Reporting Supply Chain, because it encompasses the same financial audiences and regulators and adds more stakeholders, data types, and feedback loops.
Yet, in practice many mechanisms overlap (XBRL tagging, assurance processes, etc.). So one could describe it as an overlapping set where core elements coincide, and additional elements extend outward.
