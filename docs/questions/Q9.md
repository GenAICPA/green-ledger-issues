# Q9: Is the traditional financial-reporting model an appropriate template for green reporting?

## Short Answer

Yes if extended for multi-capital and value-chain breadth.

## Detailed Answer

It’s a useful starting point, but not a perfect fit in all respects. Financial reporting models bring a long history of standardization, auditability, and clarity – qualities that sustainability reporting aspires to. Emulating aspects of the financial model can be very beneficial: for example, adopting structured formats (like the ledger concept, double-entry discipline, controlled vocabularies) and requiring the same level of documentation and internal controls for ESG data as for financial data. Regulators are indeed pushing in this direction. The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) explicitly calls for sustainability information to be reported with similar rigor and frequency as financial information, and to be digitally tagged in a comparable way to financial statements. Similarly, the IFRS International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has framed its standards such that sustainability disclosures are part of the general purpose reporting, ideally connected to financial impacts (sometimes called “sustainability-related financial disclosures” in IFRS S1).
Key elements of financial reporting to emulate include: a clear periodicity (annual reports, with possible quarterly updates), well-defined standards for what must be disclosed, and a hierarchy of information (from raw entries to audited summary statements). Green reporting can mimic the structure of balance sheets, income statements, and cashflows with analogous sustainability statements (e.g., an emissions inventory akin to an income statement of GHG, and perhaps a “sustainability balance sheet” of stocks of natural and social capital). Emulating the control environment of financial reporting is also crucial: internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) could inspire internal controls over sustainability reporting, so data is collected, validated, and reviewed systematically.
However, there are significant differences that mean we cannot wholesale apply the financial model without adaptation. Sustainability reporting covers qualitative and forward-looking aspects that financial reporting typically doesn’t. Financial reporting, at its core, is transactional and monetary. Green reporting involves scientific measures, estimates, and sometimes subjective assessments (e.g., risk of climate change on business, or social impact ratings). The financial model assumes a single unit of account (money) and a clear notion of ownership and boundary (the reporting entity). ESG reporting often must deal with multiple units (tons of CO₂, cubic meters of water, hours of community service) and wider value-chain boundaries (Scope 3 emissions, for instance, require looking at suppliers and product use beyond the entity’s legal boundaries). This is where the financial model needs extension: traditional financial reporting doesn’t fully address double materiality – but CSRD’s sustainability reporting does, requiring info both on financial impact and the company’s impact on environment/society.
Another difference is that stakeholders for green reporting are more diverse. Financial reporting primarily targets investors/creditors. Sustainability reporting also speaks to NGOs, communities, regulators, and employees. The financial model’s focus on shareholder materiality might not capture everything of interest to these stakeholders. Standards like GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) broaden the scope by focusing on impacts on society and environment, which is a different paradigm than financial GAAP/IFRS.
So, certainly use the financial reporting model as a backbone – it provides rigor, comparability, and mechanisms for assurance. Many principles (consistency, transparency, accrual concepts for timing of impacts, etc.) can carry over. But be ready to adapt or augment it: for example, incorporate scenario analysis (which is not a standard financial statement component) for climate risk, or allow narrative/contextual disclosures of sustainability strategy (similar to management discussion, but even more important for ESG). In practice, frameworks like the ISSB standards aim to integrate with financial reporting (e.g., requiring sustainability disclosures alongside financials in annual reports), while the European ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards) require a broad set of disclosures that complement financial statements. Both presume that financial reporting isn’t enough on its own but provides a template – sustainability info should be as reliable and structured as financials, yet covering topics and time horizons financial reports traditionally do not.
