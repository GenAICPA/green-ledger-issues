# Q28: Which parts of the Green Reporting Supply Chain already function today, and what is emerging?

## Short Answer

Regulations mature; ESG data exchanges and assurance standards emerging.

## Detailed Answer

Today, many elements of the Green Reporting Supply Chain are already in motion, though at varying levels of maturity:
Regulatory frameworks and standards are in place or emerging: The EU’s CSRD is a major regulatory driver requiring thousands of companies to report extensive sustainability information in a digital, standardized format. It builds on existing non-financial reporting (NFRD) but greatly expands scope and rigor. ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards) are being finalized to define the specific metrics. Internationally, the ISSB has issued IFRS S1 and S2 standards (effective 2024) for climate and general sustainability disclosures, aiming to provide a global baseline aligned with TCFD. So the “rules of the road” are falling into place, similar to how accounting standards underpinned financial reporting.
Company reporting and data collection: Many large companies have been publishing sustainability or ESG reports for years (often following GRI Standards or SASB metrics). This practice is now mainstream – over 90% of S&P 500 companies, for example, produce ESG reports. Internally, companies have built data collection processes: some use spreadsheets, but increasingly specialized software (e.g., sustainability management systems that track emissions, HSE incidents, etc.). Enterprise software vendors like SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft have released modules to capture ESG data integrated with ERP. For example, SAP’s Sustainability Control Tower and Green Ledger initiative allow companies to exchange carbon data with partners and audit their carbon footprint with actual data. Microsoft’s Cloud for Sustainability and Oracle’s Cloud Sustainability offerings similarly let companies record emissions, energy, and other metrics and produce reports. This indicates that the infrastructure for data capturing is emerging quickly, embedded in business systems.
Digital reporting technology: We're seeing the expansion of XBRL taxonomies for ESG. ESMA and EFRAG are developing a sustainability XBRL taxonomy so that starting ~2025, European companies will submit their ESG data in XBRL (inline XBRL, iXBRL) just like financials in ESEF. This is emerging; the first taxonomy draft (for climate standard ESRS E1) was released in 2023. In parallel, other regions might adopt similar tagging. This means the mechanism to make ESG data machine-readable and comparable is being built now, following the success of digital financial reporting.
Assurance and Verification: Today, a significant number of companies get some level of external assurance on their sustainability reports (often limited assurance on key metrics like emissions or safety data). With regulations (CSRD) requiring assurance, the assurance ecosystem is ramping up. The Big Four and other firms have established climate and sustainability services. The IAASB’s draft ISSA 5000 is in progress. So assurance practices exist but are evolving from voluntary to mandatory and from limited to reasonable assurance over time.
Data repositories and comparability initiatives: There are now global databases where ESG data is aggregated:
The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has companies report climate (and water, forest) data through questionnaires. Over 13,000 companies responded in 2022. This provides a big comparative dataset that investors and researchers use.
ESG rating agencies (MSCI, Sustainalytics, etc.) collect data from companies (public and via direct engagement) and score them, effectively creating comparative benchmarks.
Benchmarking studies by industry groups (like WBCSD) or government (EPA’s greenhouse gas inventory for sectors) are available, though not as standardized as RMA statement studies. We can note PACT (Partnership for Carbon Transparency) as an initiative enabling exchange of product-level carbon data between companies for comparability in value chains.
The EU is working on ESAP (European Single Access Point) which by 2027 will be a public portal for all corporate disclosures (including ESG). This will greatly enhance access to comparable data.
Value-chain data exchange: One emerging practice is companies requiring ESG info from their suppliers. For example, Walmart and other big firms use CDP supply chain programs or proprietary platforms to gather emissions data from suppliers. The SAP Sustainability Data Exchange tool (just launched, per May 2023 news) allows companies to share carbon footprint data up and down supply chains in a standardized way. That’s an emerging piece to address Scope 3 data gaps. Also, blockchain-based pilots (e.g., using Hedera, IBM Food Trust, etc.) are being tested to ensure data integrity in supply chain sustainability info. We’re not at full deployment, but pilots exist (like Hedera’s Guardian for tokenizing emissions and renewable energy credits, used in projects by corporates and even mentioned involvement of KPMG/PwC).
Integration with financial reporting: Another trend is integrated reports (combining financial and ESG narrative). While not widespread in the US, in some regions like South Africa integrated reporting is mandatory. And with investor focus rising, companies are increasingly linking sustainability performance to financial performance in their communications. Some are also integrating ESG data into investor filings (e.g., including climate risks in annual reports due to TCFD). The IFRS Foundation’s work via ISSB is essentially merging into financial disclosure context. So the line between financial and sustainability reporting is blurring (which is an emerging convergence).
Sector-specific frameworks: Certain sectors have well-established reporting for particular ESG aspects. For example, the Global Oil and Gas Industry Association (IOGP) has environmental performance data reporting among members, and the Equator Principles provide a framework for banks to assess project environmental/social risk (with reporting). These sector initiatives mean parts of the supply chain in those sectors function with common metrics.
Government-driven data collection: Already, companies must report some ESG data to regulators (beyond financial filings) – e.g., pollution inventories (EPA’s TRI in the US), EU’s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR), energy consumption reports for large facilities, modern slavery statements in some jurisdictions, etc. These are pieces of the supply chain functioning but were historically separate. They might funnel into the unified reporting now (e.g., PRTR data being referenced in ESG reports for consistency).
Emerging areas: Things like biodiversity reporting are less developed but emerging (TNFD – Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures – is developing a framework). Human capital reporting is emerging (the US SEC is considering rules to require more disclosure on workforce metrics). Social impact measurement (like impact on local communities) remains more narrative, but efforts to quantify (e.g., “social return on investment” metrics) are budding.
In summary, today’s state:
We have a lot of voluntary reporting which is now moving into mandatory regulated reporting.
Data collection tools are being rolled out in enterprises.
Standards (like ISSB, ESRS) are solidifying, replacing the fragmentation with hopefully more uniform requirements.
Digital tools (XBRL, blockchain) are being applied to ESG, albeit a couple of years behind their use in financial data – but catching up fast due to CSRD’s digital mandate.
The assurance ecosystem is gearing up.
The demand side (investors, consumers, regulators, activists) is certainly active and growing, pushing for better data (e.g., investors managing $130 trillion signed up to Climate Action 100+ demanding climate reporting).
Thus, parts of the GRSC are functioning: big companies mostly know how to measure carbon, many get it verified; investors already integrate ESG scores. But consistency and completeness are emerging now through new regulations and collaborations. In the next few years, we’ll see these existing pieces connect more tightly into a more formal supply chain akin to how financial reporting runs like clockwork.
