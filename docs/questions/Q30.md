# Q30: Which existing data collections could inspire RMA-style benchmarks for green accounting?

## Short Answer

CDP, SASB KPIs, DJSI, sector initiatives provide benchmarks.

## Detailed Answer

When XBRL was created, the idea of comparability and electronic sharing of financials (like RMA's Annual Statement Studies for industry ratios) was a motivating use-case. For sustainability, while there isn't one single analog as established as RMA was for finance, there are some analogous sources and efforts that can inspire and inform a Green Ledger:
CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) Scores and Data: CDP’s platform essentially aggregates corporate environmental data (emissions, water use, etc.) and even provides scoring (A to D-) for companies on climate action. This is reminiscent of RMA in that it collects data from many companies and allows comparisons. It has been influential in pushing companies to disclose and in giving investors comparative info. An initiative building a Green Ledger could use CDP’s large dataset as a starting point for common metrics and industry benchmarks (e.g., average emissions per revenue for certain sectors, best practices identified).
Industry Best-Practice Benchmarks: Some industries have developed sustainability “charts of accounts” or key performance indicators. For example, the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) publishes sustainability guidelines and data, the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM) does annual benchmarking on safety and environmental metrics for its members. These could inspire taxonomy elements or equations in a Green Ledger context specific to each sector.
SASB Standards and Materiality Maps: The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (now part of the IFRS Foundation) created industry-specific metrics for 77 industries. SASB’s materiality map identifies which ESG issues are most relevant to which industry and often provides typical units or ratios (like “GHG intensity per production volume” for oil & gas, etc.). This functions as a benchmarking framework: companies can compare on those SASB metrics. A Green Ledger project can draw from SASB’s work to ensure it’s capturing the right KPIs for each industry and facilitating benchmarking.
Science-Based Targets and Carbon Budgets: Initiatives such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) provide sector-specific decarbonization pathways (how much emissions reduction a steel company should achieve by year X to be 1.5°C aligned). These can serve as benchmarks: e.g., “Company’s emissions vs. sector pathway.” A ledger capturing emissions could integrate those reference points. Similarly, the Paris Agreement and IPCC budgets mean each sector has an implied carbon budget; some financial analysts create “Carbon Scorecards” for companies relative to these budgets (like TPI or Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark). These references could inspire the balancing equations or limit checks in a Green Ledger (like a “planetary boundary ledger” parallel to the company’s ledger, to compare against).
External Ratings and Indices: Consider the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) or Corporate Knights’ Global 100 rankings – these rank companies based on multiple ESG performance metrics relative to peers. The methodologies behind these indices often contain benchmark data (like best-in-class energy efficiency for a given sector). For example, DJSI invites companies to fill a detailed questionnaire and then ranks them, effectively creating a performance distribution. While proprietary, these insights could guide what metrics truly differentiate leaders vs laggards – information a Green Ledger standard might incorporate to ensure it captures those differentiating metrics.
Government or Multilateral Data: The UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators and World Bank data on sustainability-related stats (like country-level energy intensities, water usage, etc.) could indirectly inspire corporate benchmarks, especially for contextualizing performance relative to national or global averages.
Academic Research: Over time, academia and think tanks compile meta-studies. For instance, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) could potentially look across its database of reports and derive averages for certain indicators by sector or region (though historically GRI hasn’t published such comparative studies publicly, the data exists). Similarly, academic consortia like GRASFI (Global Research Alliance for Sustainable Finance and Investment) produce research on ESG performance distributions.
In essence, while we don’t have the exact equivalent of RMA (which provided median financial ratios by industry from confidential bank data submissions), we have:
Collaborative disclosure platforms (CDP),
Standard-setters providing common metrics (SASB, GRI),
Third parties aggregating and benchmarking (DJSI, MSCI, Sustainalytics, etc.),
Sector initiatives with data sharing,
Regulatory datasets (like EPA data that can identify best/worst polluters by sector).
These collectively can serve as an inspiration: a Green Ledger project can aim to standardize and digitize sustainability data much as XBRL did for financials, learning from how these existing sources structure and compare data. For example, an XBRL taxonomy for ESG will likely incorporate metrics from SASB and GRI (and indeed the ESRS XBRL taxonomy does exactly that, covering a wide range of indicators required by the new standards).
One concrete analog: RMA studies were fueled by banks sharing client financials. Today, banks and investors are pushing clients to share ESG data via platforms (like CDP supply chain or EcoVadis for supplier ESG ratings). An initiative akin to RMA could be if banks pooled anonymized client ESG performance data to produce benchmarking studies – not far-fetched as banks now face climate risk analysis on their loan portfolios. We might see something like “Annual Sustainability Statement Studies” in the future compiling average emissions intensities or average ESG scores for SMEs by sector, etc. That spirit is alive: for instance, the Poseidon Principles (banks disclosing the climate alignment of their shipping loan portfolios) essentially benchmark ships’ efficiency to a trajectory.
In conclusion, while no single RMA-like publication for ESG has dominated, there is a patchwork of sources fulfilling that role. A Green Ledger standard can be inspired by these – for comparability, to identify key data points, and to see how aggregated data can drive insight. The RMA analogy reminds us of the end goal: easy, credible comparability, which these emerging sources are striving towards in the ESG space.
