# Q37: How can definitional ambiguities (e.g., “What counts as an employee?”) be mitigated?

## Short Answer

Use controlled taxonomies, version stamps and validation rules.

## Detailed Answer

APQC’s Process Classification Framework (PCF) and similar libraries (like the U.S. Standard General Ledger’s business process list or other process catalogs) typically focus on standard business operations (finance, HR, procurement, etc.). Historically, they may not have had a dedicated section for “Green” or sustainability processes, but they do touch on related areas, and some updates may be incorporating ESG elements:
The APQC PCF is a broad taxonomy of business processes. In earlier versions, sustainability might have been a minor sub-process (for example, under “Manage Health, Safety, Security, Environment (HSSE)” in operations, or under “Develop Strategy” might include sustainability strategy).
APQC does have categories like “Operate Health, Safety, Environment Programs” as part of operations management. Those cover events like incident management, compliance with environmental regulations. These could be entry points for sustainability events in a ledger. For instance, APQC PCF category 6.0 (Manage Environmental, Health and Safety) could feed into the Green Ledger structure by providing a list of processes (like waste management, incident response) that generate data.
If APQC hasn’t formally updated the PCF to carve out “Sustainability Management” as a distinct process area, it likely will soon given ESG’s rising importance.
The U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) is more about accounts than processes, but the question mention “library of business activities and related accounts”. The USSGL includes accounts for various activities (some agencies might have accounts for environmental liabilities, or government might have specific accounts for environmental cleanup costs, etc.). The concept to leverage is that USSGL (and similar charts) categorize transactions; a Green Ledger could map sustainability transactions to these where relevant (e.g., cost accounts for environmental remediation tie to environmental impact entries).
Also, other process libraries: e.g., COBIT for IT processes might not have ESG, but something like OCEG’s GRC Capability Model does include compliance and risk processes that could incorporate ESG compliance processes.
Leveraging these:
Identify Established Processes to Instrument: If APQC lists “Manage Waste Disposal” as a process, the Green Ledger can ensure it has data capture for that process (like volume of waste, cost of disposal, incidents). Essentially, using APQC as a checklist to ensure the ledger covers all key sustainability-related operations. It ensures completeness – you’re not missing tracking of something like “training on environmental procedures” if APQC has that as a process.
Common Language for Integration: Many companies model their operations based on APQC PCF. If the Green Ledger aligns with those process names or IDs, integration gets easier. For example, an ERP might tag activities by APQC process. If we know that in APQC process 5.7 “Manage Energy” exists, a Green Ledger can expect data from that process (like total energy consumed).
Use APQC as a basis for designing sub-ledgers or modules: Perhaps structure the Green Ledger modules around APQC categories (one module for HSE, one for sustainability strategy, etc. aligned to PCF groupings). That way, when implementing in a company, it’s easier to assign responsibility: “Operations team handles processes X and thus inputs these ledger sections.”
Using USSGL or similar to tie to financials: If the US SGL has accounts for environment costs (like “Cleanup Cost Liability”), the Green Ledger could cross-reference that with environmental impact data. For instance, a liability account for reclamation can be linked to a ledger entry of how much land needs restoring (a physical measure). Process libraries like USSGL’s “business events” (like “Accrue environmental liability”) could trigger Green Ledger events (like “Record new contaminated site discovery” with relevant metrics).
Do these frameworks cover Green events currently? Likely not comprehensively. This question explicitly wonders if process libraries cover green events. APQC is member-driven, so some companies may have extended it to include sustainability governance or reporting. If not, a Green Ledger initiative could propose an extension to APQC PCF specifically for sustainability management processes (like a new category for “Manage Sustainability Performance and Reporting”). This would formalize sustainability in mainstream process thinking.
USSGL includes something like “Environmental liabilities” and possibly accounts for emissions trading (if any federal accounts exist for that). The ledger can leverage those standard definitions of accounts to ensure financial aspects of sustainability (like carbon credit assets or liabilities) are tracked in sync with physical data.
Leverage vs Extend: If existing libraries are lacking specific “Green events,” we might need to extend them. For example, APQC might not have had a process for “Engage with stakeholders on sustainability” – but that’s now vital. We could incorporate that as a recognized process and include it in the ledger structure (with metrics like number of stakeholder meetings, issues raised, etc.).
In summary, current process frameworks provide a starting structure. They might not explicitly label “Green events,” but many sustainability activities map to existing processes (like HSE processes, compliance processes, etc.). We should leverage that mapping so the Green Ledger fits naturally into enterprise process management.
If they don’t cover emerging sustainability processes, the design should incorporate them (like APQC’s or others might have to evolve). But by aligning as much as possible with known frameworks, the Green Ledger can integrate with companies’ process documentation and internal control frameworks. That means data collection can be embedded in normal workflows (since those processes are often well-defined and system-supported).
So, leverage what exists by mapping ESG data collection to known processes (e.g., waste mgmt, energy mgmt, HR training). And fill gaps by defining new process steps where needed (e.g., sustainability reporting process itself, scenario analysis process) and perhaps propose those to standards like APQC for inclusion, creating a virtuous cycle of standardization.
