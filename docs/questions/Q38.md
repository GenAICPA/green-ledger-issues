# Q38: Do existing process libraries (APQC PCF, USSGL) adequately cover sustainability events?

## Short Answer

Extend APQC/USSGL with green event categories.

## Detailed Answer

There isn't yet a universal "sustainability chart of accounts" in the way we have a financial chart of accounts, but there are some structured code sets and classifications that cover sustainability data. To list a few:
GHG Emissions Categories (Scope 1, 2, 3): This is a de facto standard coding for emissions sources (direct, indirect from energy, other indirect by category). The GHG Protocol defines categories for Scope 3 (15 categories like Purchased Goods, Business Travel, etc.). These categories can be seen as akin to a chart of accounts for emissions sources. Companies often tag emission entries with these categories for reporting. A Green Ledger should definitely incorporate these as standard codes. For example, any emission entry is labeled with Scope and category code (like "Scope3.4 - Upstream transportation").
GRI Indicator Codes: GRI Standards provide specific codes for each disclosure (e.g., GRI 302-1 for energy consumption, GRI 403-9 for work-related injuries). This functions like a standardized account code for each ESG metric. A number of companies map their sustainability data to GRI codes. A Green Ledger could adopt GRI codes as data fields or at least map to them, so that if a company tracks "GRI 303-3: Water Withdrawal" internally, that is a recognizable standard set. Additionally, other frameworks like SASB have their own metric codes by industry.
Industrial and regulatory code sets: For example, the EU's taxonomy for sustainable activities (EU Taxonomy) has defined technical screening criteria for what counts as sustainable – that is more about classification of activities than accounts, but it may impose certain metrics to track (like carbon intensity of an activity).
ISO 14001 and 50001 frameworks don't give a chart of accounts, but companies often develop internal code sets for environmental aspects and impacts as part of those systems (like aspect registers).
National regulatory codes: E.g., EPA has numeric codes for substances in reporting (like each pollutant has a code, each facility has an ID). If the Green Ledger is granular enough, using such code sets for pollutants, facility identifiers, waste codes (like EU waste codes), etc., would embed standardization. Similarly, the UN has the CAS (Common Accounting System) for environmental statistics in national accounting (used in the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting – SEEA). SEEA provides classification of environmental transactions that could inspire corporate-level accounts (like expenditures on environmental protection have categories).
Microsoft’s Sustainability Chart of Accounts (as found in their new sustainability manager in Dynamics 365) – this suggests some companies are creating internal CoAs for sustainability. Microsoft’s appears to categorize emissions by scope and maybe other groupings (subcategories). That could become a sort of template if published.
CDP's categorization of data points in its questionnaires (like sections for different emissions, energy, etc.) can be seen as a form of standardized codes for data required.
To incorporate these:
The Green Ledger design should align data fields with these standard code sets. For example, have a dimension in the ledger for "Scope (1/2/3)" and "Scope 3 category (1-15)" for emissions entries, rather than each company inventing their own category names.
If tracking waste, use standard waste type codes (hazardous/non-hazardous per definitions, or EU List of Waste codes) so that all waste entries are comparable.
For social metrics, align with known definitions (e.g., ILO definitions for injury rates, etc.) which sometimes have code lists (like cause of injury categories).
As much as possible, use existing taxonomy references: e.g., incorporate GRI or SASB code as a property of a metric in the ledger. If the ledger says "Energy Consumption Total," tag it as GRI 302-1, so we know it's the same definition as that standard.
If any formal chart of accounts for sustainability emerges (like the Microsoft one, or something from an industry consortium), the ledger can adopt it as the default categorization for internal accounting of sustainability. E.g., treat emissions, water, waste, etc., each as an "account category" with sub-accounts (similar to how financial CoA has categories). Actually, the question hints some might exist in draft or sector form. One could mention the "Sustainability Accounting Standards" like SASB by industry as quasi chart of accounts for metrics.
Mapping to Financial Chart of Accounts: Another way is linking sustainability code sets to financial accounts (for integrated reporting). For instance, if there's a financial account for "Fuel Expense," one could map that to a sustainability account "CO₂ from fuel" for emissions accounting. That mapping helps to cross-check (like Engine B tries to map financial and ESG data).
Ultimately, if no universal chart exists, the Green Ledger initiative might effectively create one by compiling best practices. That could be a deliverable: a standardized list of sustainability accounts (e.g., "Air Emissions", with sub-accounts for each greenhouse gas or pollutant; "Energy Use", sub-accounts by renewable vs non-renewable; "Social - Workforce", sub-accounts for headcount, turnover, etc.). Creating that in consultation with frameworks (GRI, SASB, etc.) ensures it covers what's needed and can be mapped back to them.
So yes, there are bits and pieces (GHG scopes, GRI codes, etc.) which we should incorporate rather than reinvent. Doing so ensures compatibility with regulations and easier reporting:
For example, CSRD's digital tagging will come with an EU taxonomy – the Green Ledger should aim to produce data that directly fills those taxonomy elements. That taxonomy (once out fully) can be considered a chart of accounts for sustainability disclosure in EU context.
In summary, while there isn’t one globally accepted “sustainability chart of accounts” yet, we have standard sets of categories and metrics that effectively function like one. The Green Ledger should adopt and integrate those:
Use standard ESG metric frameworks as the template for data fields (so it's readily reportable).
Ensure classification of environmental and social data uses known category codes (so it aligns with national/global reporting and facilitates comparability).
Remain flexible to incorporate new standard code sets as they emerge (like if ISO or others do create a more formal audit data standard for ESG, as asked in Q35, the ledger should be ready to incorporate that structure).
