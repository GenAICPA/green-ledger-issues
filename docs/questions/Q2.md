# Q2: What purposes does a ledger serve in practice?

## Short Answer

Records, aggregates and evidences data for management, investors, auditors and regulators.

## Detailed Answer

Ledgers are used to track, summarize, and report transactions or measurements in a consistent manner. In financial contexts, the general ledger aggregates all transactions (from sales, purchases, etc.) and underpins the creation of financial statements. It ensures completeness and accuracy by capturing every entry and allowing verification against source documents. The ledger provides an audit trail – every figure in a report can be traced back to a ledger entry and its source. This use of a ledger brings structural integrity to reporting: without a balanced ledger framework, statements would lack coherence and could be manipulated. Thus, a ledger’s purpose is to maintain an organized, reliable record that stakeholders (including auditors) can trust and analyze for decision-making.
