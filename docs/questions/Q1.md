# Q1: What is a ledger, broadly?

## Short Answer

A chronological, tamper-evident log of facts enabling traceability and audit.

## Detailed Answer

A ledger is a structured record of transactions or facts, recorded in sequence and maintained as a source of truth for an entity’s activities. Traditionally, a ledger is “a book... recorded in sequence for all economic transactions” and serves as the original data for accounting. It provides a foundation for compiling reports, ensuring each entry can be traced to evidence of a business event. In essence, a ledger (financial or otherwise) is a repository that captures and organizes information so that nothing is lost and everything can be accounted for.
