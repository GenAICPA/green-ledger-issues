# Q27: Which enterprise attributes and relationships must a Green Ledger capture?

## Short Answer

Industry, geography, facility, utilities, stakeholder map, controversy level.

## Detailed Answer

To have a complete picture of an organization’s sustainability context, a Green Ledger (or the system around it) should capture various attributes of the company and its operating environment, as well as key relationships that influence or are influenced by the company’s activities. These include:
Industry Sector: The industry drives what ESG issues are material (e.g., a mining company vs. a software company have very different impact areas). The ledger should note the industry (perhaps using a standard classification like NAICS or GICS), since benchmarks and relevant regulations often vary by industry. It might also capture sub-industry or particular activities (fossil fuel extraction, textile manufacturing, etc.) because these determine things like emission factors, regulatory requirements, or typical ESG risks.
Company Size and Structure: Size (in terms of employees, market cap, revenue) matters for ESG reporting thresholds (e.g., CSRD applies to large companies first). Also, size influences impact scale – a large multinational vs. a small local firm have different resource usage and scrutiny. Organizational structure (subsidiaries, supply chain span) is also important to know, as complex supply chains mean more relationships to track.
Geographic Location and Footprint: Geography is crucial. The ledger should record the regions/countries of operation and possibly specific site locations for major facilities. This is because environmental impact and regulations are location-dependent (water stress in one location vs abundance in another, local biodiversity sensitivity, local emissions laws, etc.). Also, social and political context (next point) ties to geography.
Political and Regulatory Context: The ledger or its meta-data should reflect the jurisdictions and regulatory environments the company operates in. For example, is the company under EU regulations like CSRD? Does it operate in a country with weaker enforcement of environmental laws? Political context can also include stability or conflict (if in a conflict zone, human rights issues arise). If a company spans different political contexts, the ledger might segregate data by region to show differences (like emissions in country with carbon tax vs without). Also, if the company is state-owned or in a strategic sector, that might influence its ESG obligations or exposures.
Neighbors and Local Communities: A comprehensive view includes the communities around the company’s operations. If a plant is in a city, population exposed to pollution is relevant. If in an indigenous community area, that relationship is critical. The ledger might not quantify “reputation” easily, but it could include qualitative entries or stakeholder feedback from local communities (like records of consultations, grievances logged and resolved, etc.). Also, any significant “Not In My Backyard” issues or community protests should be logged as they can drive change.
Controversy Level and Public Sentiment: As earlier discussed, knowing if the company or its industry is under heavy public scrutiny or controversy matters. For example, a company in the coal industry has high controversy nowadays. This might not be a number, but a rating from ESG agencies or simply a flag that the industry/company is considered high-risk by many stakeholders.
Information and Trading Partners: The ledger should capture major partners because sustainability often depends on them:
Suppliers: Key suppliers and their ESG profiles or any known controversies (if a supplier uses forced labor, that’s part of your scope).
Customers/Clients: In B2B, if your clients demand certain ESG standards, that pressure matters. Also, if your product is an input to something controversial (like selling surveillance tech to governments), that relationship is noteworthy.
Investors and Shareholders: Some shareholders push ESG agendas (like activist investors). Knowing if a company has, say, a group of climate activist investors is relevant (could foreshadow changes or requirements).
Utility Providers and Infrastructure: The sources of key inputs like electricity (grid vs renewable PPA) or water (municipal vs own extraction) should be recorded. For instance, if a facility is powered by a coal-heavy grid vs one on renewables, the emissions differ significantly. If water comes from a stressed river basin vs a sustainable source, that’s important.
Monitors, NGOs, and Media presence: Entities that monitor the company such as local regulators, activist NGOs, or global watchdogs (Greenpeace, etc.). If the company is part of voluntary initiatives (like UN Global Compact, Science Based Targets initiative), these relationships indicate commitment levels. Also membership in industry associations (some of which lobby on climate issues) is an interesting relationship to capture (for governance transparency).
Peer Comparison Data: Possibly, to contextualize, a ledger might link to industry benchmarks (like that RMA analogy – e.g., typical emissions per unit in this industry). Not exactly an attribute of the company, but a relationship to its peers performance.
Supply Chain Tier and Product Use: If the company is upstream vs downstream in supply chain affects how its impacts are distributed (e.g., a chemical supplier’s footprint might mainly be its operations, whereas a consumer goods company has big downstream use-phase impacts). So understanding its position in value chain and product use phase responsibilities is part of context.
In essence, the Green Ledger should not exist in a vacuum – it should be aware of where the company is situated in the broader socio-environmental system. Capturing these attributes enables more accurate analysis and relevant comparisons.
Practically, some of these attributes would appear in the metadata of reports (the CSRD digital tag requires tagging the industry NACE code, the scope of the report, boundaries, etc. – for example, ESRS likely will demand disclosure of business model, value chain description, etc., which cover many of these points). For instance, ESRS 2 (General Disclosures) will require companies to describe their value chain and relationships, key stakeholders, etc., precisely because those contextualize performance.
To sum up, a comprehensive Green Ledger should include:
Who the company is (industry, size, structure).
Where it operates (locations, regions).
Under what conditions (regulatory, political).
With whom it interacts (suppliers, customers, communities, stakeholders).
External pressures (controversies, activism, public perception).
Capturing these ensures that data from the ledger can be interpreted correctly and that reporting can be tailored to the company’s specific sustainability context, rather than one-size-fits-all.
