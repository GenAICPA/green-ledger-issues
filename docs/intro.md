# Introduction to the Green Ledger Issues

Welcome to this collaborative project focused on defining the requirements for a future "Green Ledger".

This site contains a structured discussion around 50 key questions related to building a trustworthy and auditable information supply chain for sustainability and non-financial reporting.

## How to Use This Site

You can navigate the questions in a few ways:

-   **By Thematic Cluster:** The questions are grouped into six thematic clusters. This is a great way to explore related concepts together.
-   **All Questions:** You can browse the full list of 51 questions.
-   **All-in-One:** For a linear reading experience, the "All-in-One" page presents all questions and answers in a single document.

We encourage you to read, reflect, and contribute to the discussion via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GenAICPA/green-ledger-issues).
