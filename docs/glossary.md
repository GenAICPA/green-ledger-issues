# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines some of the key terms you'll encounter in the Green Ledger discussion. It's a work in progress and we welcome your contributions to expand and improve it.

## C

**Cryptographic Signature**
: A mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. It provides a high level of security and non-repudiation.

## D

**Double-Entry Bookkeeping**
: A system of bookkeeping where every entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. The two entries are called debit and credit.

## I

**Immutability**
: The inability to be changed or altered. In the context of a ledger, it means that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be modified.

## M

**Materiality**
: A concept that defines why and how certain issues are important for a company. The definition of materiality is evolving and has different meanings in financial reporting and sustainability contexts.

:   **Financial Materiality:** In traditional financial reporting (as defined by the AICPA, PCAOB, and IAASB), a topic is material if it is likely to influence the decisions of a *reasonable investor*. This is often called the "outside-in" view, as it focuses on how external factors affect the company's financial performance.

:   **Double Materiality (Impact and Financial Materiality):** This is a concept introduced by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in the European Union. It expands the definition of materiality to include two perspectives:
    *   **Impact Materiality (the "inside-out" view):** This considers the company's impact on the environment and society, regardless of whether it has a direct financial impact on the company.
    *   **Financial Materiality (the "outside-in" view):** This is the traditional view of how sustainability issues affect the company's financial performance.

:   Under the double materiality framework, a sustainability matter is considered material if it is material from either the impact or the financial perspective, or both.

## N

**Non-Financial Information**
: Data that is not directly related to the financial performance of an organization, but is still relevant to its operations and impact. Examples include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data.

## S

**Sustainability Accounting**
: The process of measuring, analyzing, and reporting the social and environmental impacts of an organization's activities.

## T

**Tokenization**
: The process of converting a physical or digital asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This can be used to represent ownership of the asset.

## V

**Verifiable Credentials**
: A digital credential that can be cryptographically verified. It allows an individual to prove something about themselves in a secure and privacy-preserving way.
