# Contributing to the Green Ledger Issues Discussion

We welcome contributions to help refine and expand on these important questions. This document outlines the process for contributing.

## Workflow

1.  **Find an issue:** Look for an open issue or a question you'd like to comment on. Each question has its own Markdown file in the `questions/` directory.
2.  **Discuss:** Use GitHub Issues to discuss changes or disagreements. Please link to the relevant question file.
3.  **Propose changes:** If you want to suggest a change to a question or answer, please open a Pull Request.
    -   Edit the relevant `questions/Q_XX_.md` file.
    -   Provide a clear description of your change in the Pull Request.

## Keeping Answers Consistent

When editing a question file, please ensure that the "Short Answer" is a concise reflection of the "Detailed Answer".

## Labels

We use labels to manage issues and pull requests. Here are some of the labels we use:
-   `needs-sources`: The answer needs more references.
-   `terminology-alignment`: The terminology used is inconsistent with other questions.
-   `overlaps-with-QXX`: This question overlaps with another question.
-   `discussion`: Open for discussion.
